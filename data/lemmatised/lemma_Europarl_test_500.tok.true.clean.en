it be only fair to acknowledge the extraordinary contribution of this Parliament .
for Spain , which have fight to maintain the pro-European sense and the balance of the Treaty , the support of this House have be encourage and decisive .
during the negotiation , Europe have keep move forward .
we will soon have the new instrument provide for in the Treaty , together with the important expansion of the range of issue on which a decision can be take by qualified majority , in order to find solution to the concern of our people .
now more than ever , Europe must be a beacon of progress and welfare .
we can no longer delay open up and modernise our economy .
we must endeavour to achieve the objective of the Lisbon Strategy .
this must be our principal and immediate point of reference for tackle the demand of globalisation in it dual external and internal dimension .
we must be ambitious .
experience have teach u that , when we be , we tend to do well .
the extraordinary impact of the introduction of the euro , which be now be extend to new Member States , clearly show u the potential possibility if we continue to increase our integration .
we must finish develop the internal market in good , service and network and we must strengthen the institution responsible for monitor competition to ensure it proper functioning .
in it external dimension , Europe must play a leading role in develop fair rule for globalisation .
we must increase the transparency and openness of our market and support those market of our non-Community partner in a context of fair competition .
we must drive forward the Doha Round .
we must set an example in the promotion of international trade .
the globalised world require u to make a special effort in technical innovation and research , to take maximum advantage of the extraordinary potential of our scientist and university and to combine excellence with territorial cohesion .
our model of effective integration mean that all Member States should have equal access to new technology .
we want to make progress in social welfare .
ours be a social Europe , a Europe of social right .
( applause )
our economic model be inconceivable without fairness , and fairness can not be achieve without protection .
our success must be measure by our capacity to keep grow while ensure solidarity and cohesion .
we must promote stable and dignified employment , help our worker adapt to change in the productive system and be champion of policy of social inclusion , equal opportunity , safety at work and health guarantee for our citizen .
this new , ever larger Europe will only be successful if we reinforce solidarity among all the Member States .
cohesion be a fundamental principle , particularly due to the commitment that we have all enter into and due to the need to create decisive tie to ensure the political integration of the Union .
Spain , which have benefit greatly from Community solidarity , be in favour of the new Member States also be able to enjoy this benefit and be willing to share it experience so that they can make good use of this solidarity .
Europe be now immerse in a process of great strategic import : the creation of a common area of freedom , security and justice , the development of the Schengen area and the system of external border .
there can be no better evidence of our mutual trust than the pooling of security for which those Member States with an external border have assume particular responsibility .
Spain have always be at the forefront of these initiative and will continue to support them with the utmost determination .
I want to underline the importance of reinforce European immigration policy .
immigration be a reality which have already have an impact on the European agenda ; this impact will become even greater a it affect certain very sensitive aspect of our project .
we must start by unequivocally acknowledge the positive potential of immigration , which range from population support to the invigoration of cultural diversity , not forget the potential boost to our economy which have be very clear in the case of Spain .
we must favour integration policy that respect right and require obligation .
a Europe that ensure this integration will be more worthy , more free and more secure .
at the same time we must act on the cause behind migration .
we should do this through dialogue and effective cooperation with the country of origin and transit .
we must reinforce solidarity among the Member States and equip ourselves with the appropriate resource to effectively control the external border .
Spain have develop measure which be be successfully apply , but much remain to be do .
we must strengthen the European border management Agency , improve our cooperation on the ground and put out of action those mafia which take advantage of the vital and urgent need of these men and woman to escape from their life of misery and frustration .
( applause )
we be face with the major challenge of prevent and combat terrorism and organise crime .
we must be more ambitious in our police and judicial cooperation .
Spain , a a result of it own painful experience , know only too well the vital need for joint action and will always be at the forefront of this policy .
through new initiative and by lead by example , Europe must seek to develop multilateral response to global problem .
we be already do this in the fight against climate change , with our commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 20 % by the year 2020 .
we can and must lead the way , establish Europe a a reference and encourage a new consensus in the negotiation that will start in Bali in December .
we have a huge task ahead of u in the field of energy .
Spain advocate a proper energy policy with a transparent single market and guaranteed supply at the lowest environmental cost .
in our opinion , we can only have a credible European energy policy if we develop a well-articulated system of interconnection between all the Member States .
Mr President , lady and gentleman ,
we be a global player because we be not just a project for Europeans .
we will not fully achieve our goal if we only defend our own interest .
we will only achieve these goal if we project our value onto the international stage and if we consolidate our Union a an area of peace , stability and solidarity .
the success of our integration will be measure to a large extent by what we mean to others , by the meaning that our voice have for the entire world .
the future need Europe more than ever .
we must not aspire to have the world look at our great history , but at our open future .
with the new Treaty , we will have effective instrument for our common foreign policy .
the institution of the President of the Council and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and the reallocation of competence and resource will give this policy greater emphasis and continuity .
we can also use the experience of recent year in which we have equip ourselves with civil and military crisis management capability and successfully deploy in the most challenging place such a the Congo or Bosnia .
we be the lead donor of development and Humanitarian aid .
this be not only because of our concept of dignity , humanist root and sense of justice , but also because of our own interest .
only share development and fairness in the world can guarantee security in such challenging time .
in these time of profound change in the international situation , Europe must increase it legitimacy a an area of integration and democracy and develop it capacity to achieve consensus at international level .
the new Europe can not be see a isolated from it neighbour to the east and south .
our prosperity have to go hand-in-hand with theirs .
we must make our voice heard and listen to theirs in order to engage in fruitful dialogue together .
we be very commit to our relation with the country around the southern rim of the Mediterranean .
in these relation we must reaffirm the true dimension of Europe : the Europe that be interested in everything that others have to contribute , that respect difference , that offer it value without impose them and that develop partnership within the framework of the new neighbourhood policy .
the widest income gap on the planet exist between the northern and southern shore of the Mediterranean and it be in that region where deeply entrenched conflict still persist .
yet it be also true that the society in northern Africa be young and dynamic and that their political system be gradually open up allow significant freedom .
relation with the Islamic world , in which Europe must follow a path of dialogue and partnership , will be mark by the image that we portray in this region .
we must take advantage of the next EU-Africa Summit to address the justified and press demand of this suffering continent which be near to u and yet at the same time remote and which be knock anxiously on our door .
we must take action to keep it people in their own Lands , to support them in their aspiration to live and prosper there .
we must increase our active presence in all geographical area of the planet by encourage other integration process .
please allow me at this point to highlight , a an example , the importance of expand our relation with Latin America and drive forward negotiation on association agreement between the Union and the various Latin American regional group .
we must make a decided commitment to multilateralism and reinforce the central role of the United Nations in effort to mediate and participate in conflict resolution .
it be also vital that the Union make progress in define a common defence policy which will enable it to participate actively and independently in the preservation of international peace and security under the mandate of the United Nations .
development of the necessary civil and military capability , European Union Battlegroups , rapid response force initiative and European Defence Agency program constitute important advance which be , however , still inadequate .
Mr President , lady and gentleman ,
I want to share with you some basic aspect of my vision of Europe and the goal which , in my opinion , we should now set with a view to the future .
I have try to talk about Europe from Spain .
please allow me now briefly to talk about Spain from Europe .
the policy implement by my government in recent year have bear the same hallmark a the European priority .
we be go through a period of economic growth , every day open up more and introduce reform along the line of the Lisbon Strategy .
in 2007 we have already achieve one of the two main objective of our National Reform Programme , namely to achieve an employment rate of 66 % , and we will achieve the second objective , namely to fully converge with European per caput income , before 2010 , the date initially plan .
we have make a firm commitment to train human resource , provide infrastructure and expand communication technology .
in this way we be help to make Europe & apos ; s economy one base on knowledge which be competitive in the information society .
our social model have become richer and stronger .
we have healthy public finance , with a surplus of around 2 % of gross domestic product , decrease public debt and a consolidated social security system .
employment in Spain have grow spectacularly - three million new job in the last four year - and job have become more stable .
we be make progress through agreement with labour and be enjoy the period of greatest harmony in labour relation since the beginning of our democracy .
we have start to implement a social policy by establish the right to care for those who be disabled and dependent .
this will henceforth form a new pillar of the welfare state .
sustainability have become a vital part of our growth model .
in 2006 we manage to reduce greenhouse gas emission for the first time , while still enjoy intense economic growth .
we be commit to Bali a we be to Kyoto .
Spanish citizen now enjoy more right , such a greater social influence , equality between men and woman , now fully develop and guarantee by law , and , very significantly , same-sex marriage which be recognise a equal to all others and which dignify u all a a society .
Spain have support multilateralism and will continue to do so .
Spain have support the European Union and the European institution and will continue to do so .
a we have do in recent year , we will continue to increase our development cooperation so that we be among the ten leading country in the world in term of the percentage of our gross domestic product that we give to development aid .
we will keep increase this so that , within the next four year , 0.7 % of our gross domestic product will be devote to development aid , to bring solidarity and dignity to million of people around the world .
Mr President ,
for a long time we be only able to say that , if Europe advance , Spain would do so too .
I believe that I can now say today , with both pride and humility , that if Spain continue to advance a it have do , Europe will too .
I be totally convinced that Europe will exceed our expectation .
we can rely on the extraordinary capability of all it institution , particularly this Parliament .
at the most difficult time , lady and gentleman , the European Parliament have always prove to be a defence against pessimism and a courageous and tireless champion of European integration .
today I want to thank you very particularly .
your proposal and debate have influence the major reform of the Union during all these year .
in this House , among all of you , Europe can be felt with greater force than in any other place .
Europe live here with more hope and more confidence .
I therefore want my final word to express Spain & apos ; s recognition , and my own personal recognition , of the prestige and work of this House and of the labour of those men and woman of all ideology and from all country who , through the various legislature , have enable u , from these bench , to achieve the Europe of today and to prepare for the Europe of tomorrow .
we have successfully overcome the recent danger .
now we must tackle the many other challenge that await .
we must look firmly to the future and work together to quickly bring about the Europe that we need and , above all , the Europe that the world need .
many thanks .
( stand ovation )
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , esteem Prime Minister , lady and gentleman , on behalf of the Group of the European People & apos ; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I want to thank the Prime Minister of Spain for his thought on the direction of the European Union .
it be true that we would have prefer his speech and his thought on Europe to have be give at another time , before and not after the Lisbon Summit , and specifically not seventy-two hour after his appointment a Prime Minister , because these circumstance be never beneficial to achieve the real objective of such a meeting .
however , lady and gentleman , at the same time it would be unfair of me - and our Group would not want this - if I do not thank the Prime Minister for or rightly value his contribution which be without doubt very useful in term of the future direction of Europe .
it be not easy for me to speak on behalf of the PPE-DE Group on freedom and the European Union , basically because there have be personal experience in my Group which so typify the defence of freedom and which be so recent in their occurrence that I can not find sufficient or adequate word to explain the deep and real meaning of the European Union for our Group .
our Group be delight at the definite progress make at the Lisbon Summit but , at the same time , we would be lie if we do not say that our Group consider that we still do not have sufficient political momentum and ambition to transform the European Union of today into the European Union that we need for the future of the European people .
we can not achieve the Europe we need if we do not believe in ourselves .
we can not complete the European Union with inertia or fine word or simply from common ground .
word such a coherence and authenticity be not enough , for example , when tackle the transposition of European directive or comply with the Kyoto Protocol .
Prime Minister , what be miss be undoubtedly determination , defence of our value and effort .
it be these element that will enable u to consolidate the moral strength of the Union and , ultimately , it own culture which be what our project essentially stand for .
however , we must make our European citizen aware of these miss element .
we must tell them about these and clearly explain them .
we must share with them this political need for effort and dare to tell them the truth about what be miss .
they will not be discourage by this but will , in fact , provide the hope , dream and proximity that we so desperately need .
we must tell them more clearly what the problem be .
we must prioritise these and work on these urgent issue to find a way to distribute power between the European Union and the European nation , without generalise , but instead by prioritise and identify the most urgent problem that remain .
Prime Minister , agreement , consensus and a gradual approach have be the traditional European method , because consensus be a method more than a value .
this mean that we must define and organise this consensus and , at the same time , we have to empower the European political group , because there will be no European Union without European political party .
this also mean that we should not bring to this House any national disagreement or dissension ( which be real and deep ) , a be regrettably bring from Spain some month ago , a you well know .
Prime Minister , there be problem that require a European solution .
this without doubt strengthen the Union but , in the opinion of our Group , it also strengthen the European nation .
the Union will not grow stronger a the European nation grow weaker , but in fact totally the opposite : the European Union , in order to be complete , need it member to be strong and it will be impossible to complete this project with weaken nation which threaten it territorial integrity .
the value of freedom be what unite u .
this be the value to end all value and it be these value which be set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that will be sign on 12 December in Strasbourg .
however , this be not just an illusion : it be a renew commitment to freedom , and not just in the territory of our Union , but particularly in the territory of our friend with whom we have traditionally share our culture , in Latin America and also in some republic of eastern Europe .
it be in these country too that we must try to consolidate our framework of principle and value .
I have one further thing to say : coherence rather than word .
history have prove the beneficial effect of our culture on the world .
we should pass it on and , at the same time , be aware that we can not lock up this value within our European Union .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , lady and gentleman , we be very pleased to welcome Prime Minister Rodríguez Zapatero here to the European Parliament .
we be pleased , too , that you come here after the Lisbon Summit , and that you come here just 72 hour after your nomination a candidate .
we would have be even more pleased if the PPE-DE Group have at least be represent by their Group chairman today .
I can tell you one thing : Mr Daul have miss a good speech from the Spanish Prime Minister this afternoon .
he have also miss a le convincing speech from Mr Mayor Oreja , so it be probably a good thing for him that he be not here .
since the empty seat on the right of this House also tell their own story , let me say that when Swedish Prime Minister Reinfeldt visit u , who belong to their political family , the Socialist Group will be in attendance in the same kind of number a today , because I believe courtesy be a quality that you either have or you do not , and those on the right do not have it !
( applause )
Spain and the Spaniards , represent by the Prime Minister of their country , have the right to be respect , and that mean respect from all the political family in this House .
we accord the Spanish people that respect .
Mr Zapatero , you have thank this House and you have thank the European Union .
that be a very memorable sentence from the head of the government of Spain , a country which for 40 year suffer under a ruthless and brutal dictatorship , and which gain it freedom and democratic diversity through it integration into Europe .
for you , the Spanish Prime Minister , to stand up and thank the European Union do you great credit .
however , we owe you a debt of thanks too , for the fact that Spain have succeed in these endeavour .
we owe our thanks to the Spanish people and Spanish democrat , men and woman .
their contribution to Europe be a contribution to democracy , diversity , cultural progress and social stability .
we must therefore voice our own thanks to the Spanish Government .
( applause )
Spain be a model for Europe , a be the Iberian region a a whole .
the same applies , incidentally , to Greece and all those country which have to overcome fascist dictatorship and set a course towards the European Union in the early and mid 1980s .
a Western Europeans , we have the freedom to travel to these country at that time and so we can compare them then and now .
Spain be a country with a flourish economy .
it be a country with a great future , full of hope , a country whose people have make an immense contribution to peace in the world , a country which be economically prosperous and which be rightly knock at the door of the G8 country because of it economic strength .
who would have think that be possible 20 year ago ?
so why do I say that Spain be a model ?
a you yourself say , Prime Minister , if the European Union & apos ; s structural and regional policy have the same economic effect in the country which join the European Union on 1 May 2004 a occur in Spain , Europe a a whole can look forward to a very positive future , and that be why Spain be a model for Europe .
( applause )
Prime Minister , Spain - you put this very well - have win out a a result of it integration into Europe .
like many other country in the European Union , Spain relinquish some of it sovereignty when it introduce the euro .
Relinquishing sovereignty over the currency mean relinquish part of national sovereignty .
however , let u imagine for a moment what might have happen if Spain still have the peseta , and imagine if the Zapatero government , a it first act in office , have say , & apos ; we be withdraw our troop from Iraq & apos ; .
the US dollar could have play game with the peseta , and what economic effect might that have have ?
Relinquishing this currency element of sovereignty actually confer a degree of independence and sovereignty for Spain .
that be another reason why Spain be a good model , show how European integration bring more , not le , strength .
( applause )
Mr Zapatero have talk about many different issue .
on behalf of my Group and on behalf of the men and particularly the woman in my Group , may I say a few word about gender equality .
very few head of government in Europe have do more to promote the right of woman than you , Mr Zapatero , and the European Parliament owe you a debt of thanks for your endeavour in that area too .
( applause )
( ES ) Mr Zapatero , please continue with your excellent , modern and progressive policy .
they be good for Spain and what be good for Spain be also good for Europe .
keep go , Prime Minister .
( stand ovation from his Group )
Mr President , when Member States ratify the Reform Treaty , a we hope and believe they will , we can look forward , at long last , to a revitalise European Union - a Union with the capacity to confront new challenge , with the humility to listen to it citizen and with the political will to act .
ratification of the Treaty can not come a moment too soon , and my Group thanks you , Mr Zapatero , for your effort to speed up the process .
my Group see no need for a group of wise people to ponder Europe & apos ; s future .
we have be there , do that , and even have the T-shirts to prove it .
it be call & apos ; the period of reflection & apos ; and it have come to an end .
we be midway through the Lisbon Strategy and be only now make progress in growth and job .
we be complete the single market , free up the potential of Europe & apos ; s entrepreneur .
we be open legal migration pathway to help both develop and developed economy .
now be not the time to go back to a French draw board , nor to follow a new British plan for a glorified free trade zone .
those vision be just view from the margin , package a majority opinion .
they be not where consensus lie .
the majority of our citizen want the Union to deliver a strong and grow economy .
they want more EU involvement across the board , more involvement in combat terrorism , more cooperation in security and defence , and more action on the environment .
then , and only then , can Europe become a global player with the capacity to bring about lasting change .
for how can we assure growth and job if Europe retreat into protectionism ?
how can we combat climate change if we fail to act in concert ?
how can we spread peace , prosperity and justice in the world if Europe bicker at the sideline ?
that be why Europe need more politician who be prepare to lead and to take a pan-European approach .
Mr Zapatero , by unite the 18 friend of the Constitution in Madrid , you prove that your vision of an open , integrated and competitive Europe be one share by many .
it be that vision of Europe that progressives from all party in this House want to see thrive and expand .
the ALDE Group will work together with all those who share that vision and live up to it , whether on the right , on the left or in the centre , to ensure Europe move forward .
what we will not tolerate be those who profess such a vision but fail to live up to it .
Prime Minister , Spain be often quite rightly praise for it social and economic transformation since join the Union .
we need others to follow your example and pursue your ambition for a prosperous and open Europe .
( applause from the centre and leave )
on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I would like to join my colleague in welcome the Prime Minister , but in a different way .
the Prime Minister come prepare for a debate on the future of Europe but , unfortunately , hear some argument about Europe & apos ; s past rather than on where we should all be move forward .
I think that , when we look at the need of Europe for the 21st century , each of u know what those need be .
likewise , each of u know that the ideology of the past have fail to deliver in solve those need on their own .
only by a combination and a coordination of those different method and those ideal have we see progress .
whether it be in the area of equality , whether it be in the area of justice , whether it be in the area of economic development or whether it be in the area of health and safety , it have always require individual opportunity to pick and choose out of the successful method of the past .
on behalf of my Group , I should like to thank the Prime Minister for the respect he have show to this House by thank the Union and , in particular , Parliament , a the representative voice of the people of the European Union .
we see ourselves - some of the time - a be the true representative voice .
on occasion we may get it wrong , but nobody can argue with our democratic accountability and with our democratic mandate to speak on behalf of the people .
too often , the view and opinion of the European Parliament be keep to the sideline a regard what kind of discussion take place at intergovernmental level .
I be delight , some time ago , that , during the period of reflection on the Treaty that have now go and will not be around again , the Prime Minister decide to regroup the & apos ; friend of the Community method & apos ; , call it the & apos ; friend of the Constitution method & apos ; , to try and form a vanguard a regard how thing can move forward .
he saw that the success of that move open up other door and opportunity for him in government when he need support with regard to immigration and other development .
if I could make an appeal to the Prime Minister today a regard the future of Europe , I would ask that he would continue to use his influence , not just in the European Union but particularly in Latin America , where issue with regard to freedom , democracy and respect for human right be become ever more apparent under the guise of democratic movement .
finally , some of u see a vision of Europe that bring bright star , great opportunity and , most importantly , respect for the fundamental difference and dignity that exist within the European Union .
we should reach a point where no longer do we try to homogenise everything into one single shape or size but understand that , by give dignity to that difference , we can actually create a better , more colourful and , certainly , more vibrant European Union for the future .
( applause )
we also appreciate your comment on immigration , although not always your action , and we appreciate the fact that emphasis have be place on the positive aspect of immigration and not just on it illegality , a perhaps your predecessor do .
for this reason I will say to you , Prime Minister , that we have miss you in the last two year and in recent month during the institutional crisis which end , without a great deal of passion or glory , in the & apos ; mini & apos ; Lisbon Treaty .
the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference be dictate by the enemy of the European Constitution , whereas it friend , like yourself , prove to be far too discreet follow that famous meeting of the eighteen .
now in Europe we be face with several approach : the two-tier system of Sarkozy , the Atlantic nationalism of Gordon brown and the rather formal but very sincere pro-Europeanism of Romano Prodi .
what be your view ?
who be your ally ?
Prime Minister , you speak briefly about the issue of climate change , although the idea of your new contract between mankind - and womankind too I suppose - and the planet be old news .
you also talk a lot about gratitude for European aid .
a I understand it , Spain have not transpose the Eurovignette Directive and still have a very extensive infrastructure policy .
we hope that , a a result of the election promise that you have make on climate change - and there be no harm in do a bit of electoral campaigning , even here - Spain will firmly change direction .
we also hope that your fantastic Environment Minister will have much greater room for manoeuvre in your government than she have now .
( applause )
Prime Minister , to end , I must say that we here in the European Parliament very much appreciate and thank you for your word , but we need ally in the government of the Member States .
we can not rest because we need people who want Europe and have a vision of Europe .
( applause )
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Prime Minister , you make a fine speech .
in many respect it be a humanist speech which I be willing to accept a an ideal for the Europe of the future .
however , we must admit that , for the current reality of Europeans to resemble the vision you have just describe , many change must be make to the procedure and structure of the European Union .
you say that our Europe be a social Europe .
Bravo !
it be not , however , pessimistic to say that in the main this social Europe have yet to be build .
the current framework of European social policy be , accord to the Treaties , an open market economy with free competition.This be a framework that naturally encourage competition between social model and naturally tend to diminish our entitlement in the name of competitiveness .
this be a framework that naturally push down the cost of manpower , encourage job insecurity and undermines social right .
the social issue be undoubtedly the main reason for our citizen & apos ; distrust of European institution .
the President of the European Central Bank , for instance , saw this for himself when he speak recently at the European Trade Union Confederation Conference , put forward his theory , the official EU theory , on wage moderation in the name of competitive price .
he encounter unanimous opposition .
I have already say that the German Finance Minister mention the risk of a crisis of legitimacy in the European social and economic model .
let u , therefore , take a look at these aspect , precisely to give some credibility to your vision of the future .
you also mention relation with Africa and the need to provide a response to their call for justice .
you be right .
however , in that case , for instance , we must come back to the draft economic partnership agreement which have be reject by all our African partner because they feel sure - and I think they be right - that development of human capacity and free trade be not a good mix .
to end , Prime Minister , I wish to thank you for remind u of what I feel to be Europe & apos ; s ultimate objective , and if we still can not agree a to our view of the present , let u at least agree a to the future prospect .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , it be a pleasure to see the Prime Minister here in Brussels .
he be an exemplar to other European head of government , a a man who allow his own people to decide whether they wish to have the Constitution .
for that he must be applaud .
in the event , the people of Spain vote overwhelmingly to support the plan .
what I would like to know be why he have no intention of repeat the exercise .
after all , he should be confident that he will get a similar result .
be it because , a the Prime Minister have say , the Reform Treaty have not let a single substantial point of the Constitutional Treaty go ?
if so , it would stand to reason that he feel there be no need to ask his people the same question twice .
or , be it the case , a present to the British people , that the Reform Treaty be so different a to be an entirely separate thing altogether and too complicate for the people to understand ?
this , of course , be key to all our future .
either the political elite do not care what people want , a in the case of Mr Sarkozy and Mr brown , or they feel that the people be too stupid to make any decision more important than what burger to buy at McDonalds .
it seem to me that the European Union be rapidly become the world & apos ; s first post-democratic state .
I can tell the Prime Minister this : if the European elite do not allow the people to speak , then , in the end , they will find other way to make their voice hear .
( NL ) Mr President , lady and gentleman , in my view the biggest challenge face the European Union at the moment be the total lack of democratic participation in the decision making process .
the European institution be increasingly distrust - quite rightly in my opinion , a it happen - by our citizen who do not accept that many very important decision which directly affect their life be make in ivory tower which be no longer monitor by any mean or person .
no democratic basis , moreover , exist for these decision .
I will give two example .
first example : the text of the new European treaty will soon be sign in Lisbon .
everyone know that it be a barely-altered version of the European Constitution .
Mr Zapatero himself have say of it that not one substantial component have be change .
well now , that text be vote down by democratic referendum in France and in the Netherlands , but that have all be laugh off now .
the best-case scenario , a it happen , be that we may perhaps get another vote from time to time to keep the Eurocrats happy , but actual democratic statement make by mean of referendum be be throw out with the trash .
in this way , I fear that Europe be increasingly heading towards become a small club of the type which , if it govern a super-state , will tolerate no participation and consequently can no longer really be call a democracy .
the same applies , a a matter of fact , to the way in which the possible accession of Turkey to the European Union be be handle .
our citizen do not want it , quite the reverse , a Turkey be not a European country - not culturally , not geographically , not religiously , not in any way at all - but , nevertheless , the Commission and the Council be take no account of the opinion of the majority of our citizen on the matter .
instead of a debate about the future of the Union , we should have a debate about the convalescence of democracy in the institution of the European Union .
President of the Spanish Government . - ( ES ) Mr President , I firstly want to thank everyone who have speak for their comment and the tone of these .
I can also say that I be delight at how lively this debate have be , which be in fact just what I have hop for .
I be also delight to have be able to contribute to a debate of such liveliness and intensity , particularly give some of the speech for which I thank you from the bottom of my heart .
Spain be grateful to the European Union , to the found father and to the large country such a France , Germany and Italy which have help u to bring democracy to our country , which have welcome u into Europe and which have then , with their resource , contribute to our development .
we be grateful to other public figure and statesman that I have not mention today , such a Helmut Kohl , Mr Mitterrand and Mr Palme who have contribute so much to both the democracy of Spain and it future .
we feel very proud to be contribute to this common cause .
this gratitude be accompany by the thought of what Spain have be able to achieve in the last 25 year .
probably no other society in the world have see such a political and economic transformation and such progress in it right , freedom and the social situation of it people a Spain have see in the last 25 year .
Spain have always be very committed to Europe and have always be very pro-European .
representative of all party , culture and political ideology and representative with great political weight have serve the European institution , in the Commission and in this Parliament where we have have three Presidents .
all have serve very well and I want at this point to pay tribute to those who have represent Spain in the European institution .
they have manage to forge a common pro-European culture in a form of political organisation which , accord to the speech that have just be make , be unprecedented .
the political union that we call the European Union have no precedent or model to turn to because it do not fit within any of the known political classification .
therein lie the greatness of the European Union and also it unpredictability give the necessary process of establish a common will share by 27 country , 27 flag , 27 state , 27 nation , 20 language and a wealth of ideology that can be see here in the European Parliament .
a a result , every advance that we have make in the European process have have no one colour and have come from no one country or ideology.It have have no one colour , no one ideological colour , and no one flag .
in fact every advance have be the sum of all part with it own flag and it own colour which be that of coexistence and unity .
if anything really represent the European soul , it be a union of democrat .
that be Europe : a union of democrat which mean make progress base on position which be a consensual a possible , which respect and involve everyone and which offer the same opportunity , even to those who profoundly disagree with what the European Union represent .
the greatness of the European Union lie in the fact that it be a club which offer the same opportunity to those who be in favour of Europe and to those who do not want Europe to advance .
that be the greatness of the European club ; that be the greatness , in short , of a union of democrat .
someone refer to a & apos ; mini Treaty & apos ; .
the perspective that we adopt can always leave u unsatisfied in term of achieve our objective , but if this new Treaty be ratify by everyone and if it work , it will be a great Treaty , not a mini Treaty .
that at least be the position which , in my opinion , we should adopt today .
we must give it time and see the potential that it may have when bring into force and when use to tackle the challenge that lie ahead .
reference be make to ratification of the Treaty .
this be necessary because Spain be one country which hold a consultative referendum on the Constitutional Treaty which have since be through a process of renegotiation with the nature of a treaty , in the most classic sense of what the European concept represent .
I have be ask - and I do not want to avoid any question - why we do not submit this to a referendum .
there be two very obvious reason : the first be because the Spanish people say they be in favour of a Constitutional Treaty .
the Treaty that we have now adopt , pending ratification , which be already know a the Lisbon Treaty , contain many of the aspect of the earlier Constitutional Treaty .
the second reason , which be very important , be that there be broad consensus in our country on the parliamentary ratification of this Treaty , both among those of u who agree with this Treaty and even among the minority who do not agree .
however , I must make one point which I feel be important for the future .
I do not know whether we can achieve this at any point , but it be an obvious problem in the European Union : we have an imperfect system of ratification on which there have never be any in-depth debate .
in my opinion , ratification should be common , by all country , and , if possible , in a single act and with a single instrument .
this be clearly difficult at the moment , but very desirable , and I hope that in time we can have this type of ratification .
some speaker raise the issue - which have exist from the start , since the foundation of the Union in it first configuration a the European coal and Steel Community and then a the European Economic Community - of the relationship between the European Union and the nation state .
this issue have often call into question the whole democratic health of the European Union , a many decision be logically take through an intergovernmental procedure .
I will now very briefly give my opinion on this issue .
firstly , the nation state be a form of political organisation which , in historical term , seek to unify territory , rationalise public action and subsequently pave the way to democratic system .
it have therefore fulfil an important historical task .
the European Union be a form of political organisation which be base on the experience of the nation state .
it be a higher stage of the nation state.It do not take anything away from the nation state , but rather add to this and it traditional configuration .
this be because , a demonstrate by the history of political coexistence , political civilisation and political community , to unite usually mean to add .
uniting and sharing be what the European Union be all about .
it be not about take anything away from or weaken what the traditional concept of the nation state represent .
in fact , the stronger the European Union be , the stronger our nation state will be .
that be my opinion .
this also mean that the European Union will be more capable , through it institution which need legitimacy and constant legitimation by the politician and government of these country ...
I absolutely reject one particular theory which exist in the European Union which be that , for many of the problem that exist in our economic , private or social life , responsibility lie with Brussels .
this attitude be detrimental to the integration of the European Union and to our citizen and be also , on most occasion , usually incorrect .
I believe that history can show u and the present can teach u that the tendency to blame others for what we have fail to achieve result in melancholy and a negative attitude among people .
some speaker mention concrete objective and fine word .
I agree : there can be no action without word , and no word without action in term of political action .
I therefore believe that everything that represent an option for the future have to have priority , political priority which be credible and which be observable in action and in decision .
these be under discussion .
I will summarise the three that seem most important to me for the future of the European Union .
please allow me to say that these priority have nothing to do with treaty or operating rule or structure or revision of legislation or the reduction of legislation by the Commission which , however , would be very convenient .
they relate to the political objective of the time in which we be live .
I agree with the person who say that the European Union be the fruit of the interaction of many ideology and many value .
however , the European Union can be a regional force lead the world in value and action only if it correctly identify the priority of the historic time in which we be live now at the beginning of the 21st century .
the first priority be to look at what Europe know , because the best experience of this continent constitute a priceless lesson .
science , creativity and innovation be what have make our economy strong and our country socially integrated .
the challenge now pose by science , which be both a challenge and an opportunity , be climate change and energy source .
I must underline something that be say in some of the speech because it be not well-known and I do not make it very clear in my speech .
it be true that Spain be a long way from meet the requirement of the Kyoto Protocol .
this may be true , but it be also true that , in 2006 , in other word one year after my government come to power , greenhouse gas emission be reduce by 4 % even though the economy grow by 4 % .
we be therefore engage in intensive action which will continue with regard , firstly , to alternative and renewable energy and , secondly , to energy efficiency and saving .
some 20 year ago , the big debate on how to take the lead in innovation in Europe - I be sure that this Parliament have this debate on innumerable occasion - be all about develop the new economy , the economy of information technology .
now the new economy that will ensure the future of productive capacity and therefore it prosperity will be the economy which can , a quickly a possible , reduce our dependency on coal and provide an alternative energy source which be increasingly powerful .
in my opinion this be the first challenge .
I must stress that this be not only a challenge but also a great opportunity , because herein lie a good part of the knowledge that be go to guarantee u many thing and also a good part of the potential source of job and activity with greater add value and , therefore , with good social capacity .
secondly , Europe must advance socially .
it be true to say that Europe can only advance socially , bear in mind the African continent , the Latin American continent or part of the Asian continent , if at the same time we make determined and decisive advance in cooperation and development aid .
this be because , and please forgive me for say this publicly , I do not know what the people and government of many country in Africa can think when they see the European Union sometimes have a debate on what it think about a deep crisis .
I do not know what they can think .
I be just say how I see it .
I believe that , fortunately , thanks in particular to our work on democracy , innovation capacity and the welfare state which be bear in this continent , thanks to these three value ( work , democracy and the welfare state ) , we can be the continent and the Union which have the best social protection and the highest level of income and welfare .
for me , improve social welfare continue to be a fundamental objective .
an open economy and a social state with social right for the people be not incompatible.In fact , these be complementary .
social policy do not consume wealth .
they can help to create wealth , to create the condition so that everyone can participate , through education with equal opportunity , reconciliation of family and work life which require a social policy , and employment stability which be the best incentive for productivity in the task of help to create wealth .
social policy with productivity and people-oriented objective be a possible model which work .
of course , the model which can achieve the biggest transformation be the model of full integration and full equality for woman in all labour and social sphere .
Spain have change a great deal , in part due to democracy in the last 30 year .
however , what have change Spain the most have be the integration of woman into work life , social life and the civic life of the country .
that be what have change u most and what have change u for the better , for definite , because it have involve value of solidarity and progress .
I want to remind you that I have a government which consist equally of men and woman ; none of the people here be actually from the government .
finally , I want to mention our third objective which , together with the challenge of climate change , the extension of social welfare and the affirmation of social right , must be develop a a trade mark of Europe .
it have enable u to get where we be and to be a reference point for other country .
this third main objective be to ensure and reinforce coexistence in a very particular manner , bear in mind that we live in a continent which , in the last 20 or 30 year , have see increase demographic change in many country .
this coexistence mean integration and absolute and total intolerance of any sign of racism and xenophobia .
this be what coexistence mean .
Europe must not betray a single one of it value and , if there be one essential value in the democratic Europe , it be respect for cultural and religious diversity and therefore the firm rejection of any sign of xenophobia or racism .
we would fail a Europeans if we succumb to this temptation .
this coexistence must be accompany by great tolerance .
increase individual and collective right be not only the best expression of freedom , it be also another value with which , in my opinion , Europe must identify .
for indeed , what better freedom can there be than respect the religious , cultural and political belief of everyone or their sexual orientation when form a partnership or enter into a marriage ?
what better expression of freedom be there than this ?
if Europe be the union of democrat , a I say before , it can not be just about freedom : Europe must be about freedom and equality .
( applause )
many thanks , Prime Minister .
you will not be speak again but you will nonetheless be stay here to listen to further speaker .
the meeting of the Bureau be about to take place , so I would like to thank you , before I go , for your visit and your speech .
I would like to thank you and Spain - all the government which work in a free Spain on European matter - for your contribution to Europe .
base on our experience of the last two decade , we be confident that no matter who govern in Spain in future , Spain will always remain true to it European call .
in this spirit , may I thank you once again very warmly for your visit today .
( FR ) Prime Minister , I will limit my remark to the issue of immigration , a major concern for the future of Europe in relation to which you make some consensual proposal .
it be true that nobody can teach any lesson in such a difficult area , but it be also true that nobody can feel they be exempt from the solidarity require in a unified space .
opinion poll show that certain country have a more economic approach , and others a more cultural approach .
in country that place economic interest first , of course it be convenient to secure essential labour by adapt the law , and hence the regularisation measure occasionally adopt en masse by national government , without worry too much about the concern that this cause , while the other Member States attempt to control migratory flow .
we could mention , for example , your government & apos ; s operation to regularise hundred of thousand of illegal immigrant .
France express it regret and disapproval at the time .
our President be quite candid about it .
there must be no repetition of this kind of operation in the future .
all the more so since Spain legitimately receive EU fund to deal with the dramatic situation on it African border .
the PPE advocate policy base on individual processing of application for regularisation , and therefore refuse to accept en masse regularisation which do nothing but increase concern .
along the same line , the French Presidency will propose a European immigration pact .
moreover , Prime Minister , in the year to come , the Lisbon Treaty will provide the mean to act in unison and refrain from implement go-it-alone policy .
this be in the long-term interest of the European Union , Spain and all the Member States .
( ES ) Mr President , Prime Minister , Vice-President of the Commission , lady and gentleman , on behalf of the Spanish Socialists I should like to thank the Prime Minister for come here today .
it have be say that his speech be an ideal speech .
it have also be say that he have a very ambitious agenda .
what I should like to say to the Prime Minister , first of all , be that his approach have be prove in practice ; in other word , he have give a series of economic , political and social data that not only justify pro-Europeanism in general but also in fact .
at this point , please allow me to briefly refer to something that be say here today .
the issue of mass regularisation be mention .
at the moment , France and Germany be copy the system of regularisation
( applause )
adopt by Spain , involve individual regularisation and the participation of employer and trade union .
please tell u , Mr Toubon , what be happen in your country .
secondly , Mr President , I want to give my personal thanks to the Prime Minister for the reference he make to certain veteran and to our work which we have be carry out here for many year .
I want to make one point in this respect : in addition to what we have receive - and it be only right and proper to be grateful - we have contribute certain element .
the popular and social Europe , cohesion and the Charter of Fundamental Rights be not under Spanish copyright but they have be heavily influence by Spain and of this we can feel legitimately proud .
a regard ratification , I agree with what the Prime Minister say .
what be strike be that people who have do nothing in their country and who have not take one step towards ratify the Constitution or approve the Treaty be try to give lesson to those who have do their job .
( applause )
I must now make one very specific point .
in this ratification process , there have to be a call for solidarity and mutual loyalty ; it be not right that some do their job while others try to renegotiate .
this must stop in Europe once and for all .
finally , Mr President , Mr Mayor Oreja have suffer a slip of the tongue because he have re-elected Mr Zapatero a Prime Minister some month before the election .
Mr Zapatero be , at the moment , only a candidate for Prime Minister .
what would be interesting be if , with a view to the election of the next Commission President , the political group , start with the PPE-DE Group , be to pass the candidate a copy of Mr Zapatero & apos ; s speech .
( applause )
( ES ) Prime Minister , welcome to this House .
fortunately , in Spain , the commitment to European construction have unite most of the political force , include those in Catalonia .
this unity , which begin in 1986 , continue with the euro and be repeat in the debate on the European Constitution .
it have enable previous government and also your own government to lead the campaign for a political and ambitious Europe .
your speech today confirm this same commitment and I congratulate you on this .
however , Prime Minister , your responsibility do not end with enthusiastic speech lade with European fervour .
Europe need leader commit to it project in their day-to-day political action and not just on solemn and institutional occasion .
we can not always see this commitment day to day in certain action of your government , with the result that unproductive confrontation with the European Commission can not be avoid .
we also can not see this commitment in those people who seem to wait for others to take the initiative before decide on their own position .
in any event , it be time for the political leader to build a Europe which give it people hope for this joint project .
this be because , Mr Zapatero , Europe be more than just the sum of the domestic success of it government , include those that you may have have .
the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty will mark the end of one phase , but the work will only just have begin .
it will be time to continue build a space of freedom , security and justice ; time to build a truly European immigration policy ; time to improve the competitiveness of our company and the welfare opportunity of our citizen , and time also to raise the voice of Europe in the world and improve relation with our neighbour , include those in the Mediterranean where so much help can be give by Spain .
without renounce or fail to reflect it extreme national and linguistic diversity , Spain therefore have much to offer in make this great common ideal a reality and you , if the ballot box give you back the confidence to govern , either alone or in company with others , will have to make an absolute personal commitment to achieve these objective .
( LV ) Thank you , Mr President .
Prime Minister , the Lisbon Treaty adopt in December will not just shape institutional precondition for Europe & apos ; s future .
paradoxically , however , one of the Constitutional Treaty & apos ; s basic task be to make it more comprehensible and acceptable to European society .
a a member of the European Convention I object to the use and the spirit of the word & apos ; constitution & apos ; for the new treaty .
the outcome of Lisbon follow an approach that I endorse , but I do not think that the reason for the change will serve Europe & apos ; s future .
thank you .
( ES ) Mr Zapatero , I be absolutely delighted that you be here today and that you have place such importance on the challenge of climate change and also on the need to act now .
welcome to the club .
at the same time , word must be accompany by positive political decision and the undeniable truth be that Spain be still the black sheep on climate change with figure well behind the Kyoto target .
this require a substantial response in term of renewable energy ; we need a policy with taxation .
I be very happy about the , albeit deceptive , proposal make with regard to the additional cent on petrol .
at the same time , I should like Spain to present a proposal on a European-wide environmental tax to tackle the avalanche of foreign product and import of pollute product .
we would be delight if the extensive coal subsidy could be abolish , at both European and Spanish level , if tax measure to reduce the crazy Spanish energy consumption could be take seriously and if investment in infrastructure could be redirect towards the railway and other form of public transport and not towards the road .
on a more positive note , I should like to congratulate you most sincerely on the abandonment by Spain of nuclear energy .
this gradual abandonment be very important and I would ask other European leader to take note of this because nuclear energy be very expensive , very dangerous and very slow to build and be not the answer to climate change .
( ES ) welcome Prime Minister .
you know that I be in one of those minority that would have like the Lisbon Treaty to also have be submit to a referendum in Spain and in all the Member States .
I have listen to you closely and there be still time for you to take the lead on this .
there be still time for Europe to hold a referendum , in all the Member States , on the same day , to take account of the one fundamental element in our history : the people .
our position be not merely window-dressing ; it be deeply democratic in the sense that we can not build a European project or finish building this without the direct participation of the people .
I believe you be be excessively optimistic when you say that we have finish build our social Europe .
in this House we very often have to co-legislate with direct attack on the European social state in term of work and job security .
we currently have a debate ongoing about flexicurity .
I therefore believe that we have a debate pending on the consolidation of this social state .
I will end with a request , Prime Minister .
the EU-Africa Summit be imminent .
please do not forget the occupied territory of the Western Sahara .
Spain and the European Union have a fundamental responsibility in this area .
the United Nations Security Council have demand a right of self-determination and it be up to u in the European Union to give substance to this demand and , if possible , to realise it at the EU-Africa Summit .
( SK ) Prime Minister , you have pay your respect to Parliament , and I would like to pay my respect to you and , through you , to Spain .
the future of Europe represent a massive task for the European Parliament .
in the context of adopt legislation , the codecision system be be extend to cover 68 areas.These be energy , climate change , structural fund , cooperation in criminal law , intellectual property , and so on .
the European Parliament be become co-legislator for 95 % of European legislation.Therefore Parliament will be decide double the amount of legislation that it do today .
moreover , the European Parliament will elect the President of the European Commission who will have to report to the European Parliament on each of his discussion in the European Council .
therefore , in 2009 , the European Parliament will be the strongest Parliament since it first session in 1968 .
it will be an equal partner with the other European institution .
therefore we will be oblige to increase turnout in the election to this strong body in 2009 .
turnout in the last election to the European Parliament be the lowest ever .
only 47 % of the electorate take part , and in Slovakia , which I represent here , the figure be a low a 11 % .
a great deal of work lie ahead of u .
( de ) Mr President , Prime Minister , colleague , lady and gentleman , actually , I want to congratulate Mr Schulz .
he have manage to ensure that he will get a pat on the back from his Socialist friend with his dull - if not to say dumb - polemic direct at the PPE-DE Group .
soon after he have finish speaking , there be just a many empty seat on the Socialist side a there be over here .
Tempting though it be to claim that the Socialists only listen to their great leader but be not interested in debate , I will refrain from do so because we be suppose to treat each other with respect .
I think an apology be warrant from Mr Schulz .
let me inject a bit of life into the debate by ask you this : what lesson have we actually learn today ?
well , we have find out that the Spanish be a European nation .
I think I be right in say that they be the same nation when Prime Minister Aznar address u .
however , we have also hear a domestic policy speech with an eye to the election .
I do not think it be the task of the European Parliament to go along with that .
Angela Merkel and President Sarkozy be also here , and they do not pursue a domestic agenda ; they talk about Europe .
these debate be only of any value if we look at matter of detail .
