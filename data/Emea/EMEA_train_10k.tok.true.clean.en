&quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
&quot;
&quot; due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .

&quot; 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
&quot;
&quot; Abraxane should not be used in pregnancy , and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception , unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment with paclitaxel .
&quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot;
&quot; the haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
&quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .

&quot;
&quot; studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot;
&quot;
&quot; no evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
&quot;
&quot; 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling
&quot;
&quot; Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
&quot;
&quot; the pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
&quot;
&quot; Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
&quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .

&quot;
&quot; care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
&quot;
&quot; when concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .

&quot;
&quot; Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
&quot;
&quot; in some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
&quot;
&quot; in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .

&quot; an increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
&quot;
&quot; ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
&quot;
&quot; in addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
&quot;
&quot; the clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe ( Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l ) .

&quot;
&quot; the extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .

&quot; what ABILIFY is AND what IT is used for
&quot;
&quot; there is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .

&quot;
&quot; in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
&quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
&quot;
&quot; Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
&quot;
&quot; a slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptoms .

&quot;
&quot; in cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .

&quot; in addition , cases of stroke or &quot; &quot; mini &quot; &quot; stroke have been reported .
&quot;
&quot; however , if the haemoglobin has increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .

&quot; 12 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
&quot;
&quot; Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot;
&quot; in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
&quot;
&quot; iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .

&quot; 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
&quot;
&quot; based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
&quot;
&quot; the incidence of these symptoms decreased markedly with subsequent doses of Aclasta .
&quot;
&quot; qualitative AND quantitative composition
&quot;
&quot; weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
&quot;
&quot; Abilify was also more effective than placebo at preventing manic episodes returning in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks , and when it was used as an add-on to existing treatment .

&quot; in a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
&quot;
&quot; the extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
&quot;
&quot; this medicine has been prescribed for you .
&quot;
&quot; based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
&quot;
&quot; in some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .

&quot; at the start of your therapy , Abseamed may be injected by medical staff .
&quot;
&quot; Breast-feeding mothers should not take ABILIFY .

&quot; this means that aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine to activate the receptors , but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters .
&quot;
&quot; the incidence of post-dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Aclasta administration ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot;
&quot; in order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
&quot;
&quot; the half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
&quot;
&quot; mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .

&quot; however , if the haemoglobin has increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
&quot;
&quot; based on the published literature , in vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins , using paclitaxel at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 1.2 µM , indicate that about 87 % of paclitaxel is bound ; the presence of ranitidine , dexamethasone , or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel .

&quot; the clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe ( Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
&quot;
&quot; in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .

&quot; all of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
&quot;
&quot; it could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .

&quot; in view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .

&quot;
&quot; the mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
&quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .

&quot; in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .

&quot;
&quot; in haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
&quot;
&quot; moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of &gt; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events cannot be excluded .
&quot;
&quot; discontinue therapy
&quot;
&quot; in most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
&quot;
&quot; Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician ´ s evaluation of the individual patient ´ s clinical course and condition is necessary .
&quot;
&quot; precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .

&quot; 4.3 Contraindications
&quot;
&quot; how to take ABILIFY
&quot;
&quot; Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
&quot;
&quot; there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .

&quot;
&quot; general classification for supply
&quot;
&quot; the following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and Generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
&quot;
&quot; the highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
&quot;
&quot; the potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
&quot;
&quot; the clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe ( Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
&quot;
&quot; patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
