the result of the major European neighbourhood Policy Conference on 3 September also show that our partner and our Member States be now fully in agreement with this prioritisation .
the conference be a real success , because it bring all of our ENP partner and all the Member States together for the first time , along with representative of the various authority and of civil society .
a clear consensus emerge on the substantive priority of the neighbourhood policy , from economic integration to greater mobility , and from energy policy to political cooperation .
Parliament can play an especially prominent and important role in the realm of political cooperation , and of course you be also a catalyst for the development of democracy , for human right and for reform lead towards the establishment of the rule of law , to which we naturally attach the utmost importance here , and which serve a a compass of this neighbourhood policy .
the neighbourhood policy be already yield definite result too .
one need only consider how much we have intensify our cooperation with Ukraine in the ENP framework since the Orange revolution .
the fact that Ukraine have now hold free and fair election for the second time undoubtedly constitute a success .
I hope that the political decision-makers in Kiev will now maintain the momentum of recent week .
we shall continue to work with you on the implementation of major reform too , with the aid of the substantial ENP Action Plan .
negotiation be progress on an enhanced agreement , which , a you be aware , be intend to bring Ukraine a close a possible to the European Union .
we shall also continue , of course , to support Ukraine & apos ; s accession to the WTO so that we can establish a comprehensive free-trade area , and we have already - a you know - conclude a visa-facilitation agreement with Ukraine and hope that the same can be do soon with the Republic of Moldova , each of these agreement be accompany by an agreement on readmission .
Morocco be another enthusiastic beneficiary of this neighbourhood policy , and be use it astutely a an engine of modernisation , which be precisely what we want to happen .
we have very clearly commend Morocco & apos ; s progress on the basis of it detailed internal reform programme , and the new aviation agreement and Morocco & apos ; s close energy cooperation with the EU , for example , be good model of fruitful cooperation .
only last week I be in Rabat for talk , at which I also initiate further progress on the joint reflection process we begin in July with a view to meeting Morocco & apos ; s request for advanced status in the ENP framework .
I be confident that in the second half of next year we shall be able to present appropriate proposal on a new and advanced form of association .
the neighbourhood policy , then , be work , but we must go further , of course , in our effort to make it even better , even more effective and even more comprehensive .
last December the Commission publish recommendation on way of strengthen the ENP , which our President-in-Office of the Council have already present .
I believe we have take some very important step .
for example , our eastern partner lack a regional dimension , but now we have launch this Black Sea synergy programme a a tailor-made process for the East .
it give the East what the South have long possess in the form of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership , and the first meeting in the Black Sea synergy framework will take place in 2008 .
we have also make progress towards open Community programme and agency to our neighbour .
this year we shall also be award the first allocation from the new governance facility , through which we be demonstrate that we can and will offer more to those partner that display genuine reforming zeal .
in addition , before the year be out we shall have establish the neighbourhood Investment facility .
it purpose be to help mobilise fund for the neighbourhood policy over and above our normal budget , primarily to make it possible to fund the large-scale project in area such a energy and transport .
I do believe we can claim some success , but we now need your continued support and that of the Member States to enable u to make further improvement and take further step .
I be think mainly of closer economic integration and of more intensive free trade with our partner .
their integration into the EU internal market be , of course , a very powerful reform lever .
for this reason we must also gradually open our market , even to what we call sensitive agricultural good and service , in which our partner have certain competitive advantage .
this mean that we must also ask ourselves whether we be prepared to do that .
the second thing I be think of be further visa-facilitation measure , which be urgently require to facilitate contact between people in different country .
these measure can often be take within the exist rule , provide there be enough political will to use the available scope , and we must continue to develop the political dimension of the neighbourhood policy .
this relate to the frozen conflict we see in the partner country on our eastern border , conflict that seriously impede our neighbour & apos ; progress towards reform and , in some case , threaten our own security .
for this reason the neighbourhood policy must help to create the right climate for the resolution of conflict such a the one in the southern Caucasus .
in the Mediterranean region , I shall naturally continue to press for progress in the Middle East , especially in the Quartet framework , and I very much hope that the meeting in Annapolis and the subsequent donor & apos ; conference in Paris will materialise so that further genuine progress can be make in the Middle East .
we be also prepare to help the party to the conflict in the Western Sahara in their quest for a long-term solution .
in the coming period our neighbourhood policy will be sharply focus on practical implementation .
we must all pull together in order to maintain and intensify the dynamic of reform that have develop among our partner .
next month the Commission will adopt another communication on the neighbourhood policy , in which we shall outline the step which the EU need to take in order to deliver further tangible result in 2008 , in other word our own contribution .
in April we shall then present the country-by-country progress report , in which we shall analyse where our neighbour can further improve the implementation of the action plan .
at the beginning of December some fundamental question will have to be ask , such a whether the Commission be fully aware of the various capacity and goal of individual neighbouring country .
a I have say , however , we can make a good deal of progress on the basis of this differentiated approach .
it seem to me that importance also attach to the concept of ownership and the local potential for put the ownership principle into practice , a well a to even greater involvement of civil society , an area in which we could still do far more .
I must not omit to add a few word on the event in Georgia , which we have be discuss together .
I merely want to add that we be very concerned about the latest development in Georgia .
we regret the excessive use of force on the part of the Georgian state security force in break up demonstration and close down independent television station .
I believe we need an independent inquiry into these incident .
we also remain concerned about the continue state of emergency and the restriction on the freedom of the medium , for curtail constitutional right and close down medium operator be draconian measure which be inconsistent with those democratic value that underlie our bilateral relation with Georgia and that Georgia have pledge itself to uphold .
we therefore expect these measure to be lift without delay .
I welcome , on the other hand , the decision take by President Saakashvili to hold presidential election and a referendum on the date for parliamentary election , thereby meet the main demand of the opposition .
I hope this will help to ease tension , and I appeal to all involve to keep political dispute within the bound of the normal democratic process and to return from the street to the negotiating table .
we need the right condition for a fair and transparent electoral process .
I just want to add that .
do forgive me for take longer than usual , but since I bear particular responsibility on the basis of the precept that politics be about people , you will understand that these matter be particularly close to my heart .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . - Mr President , the Committee on Regional Development view a strengthened European neighbourhood Policy a a key tool first and foremost to bring our neighbour closer to the European system of value .
an efficient and open ENP can provide multiple incentive for boost economic , legal and social reform in country border the EU .
true , the ENP be not to be see a a direct route to EU membership .
therefore , the conditionality principle in the EU approach should provide workable mechanism to encourage necessarily economic and democratic change in our partner country , in accordance with their own willingness and progress .
the ENP can only function a a two-way street .
on a political level , I think the ENP would provide u with a wonderful opportunity to deepen regular political dialogue with country which be willing to align their foreign policy position with those of the EU , country like Ukraine , Moldova , Georgia , Armenia and others .
the Committee on Regional Development stress the crucial importance of cross-border and interregional cooperation programme in implement the ENP .
these programme should include economic and environmental a well a social and cultural aspect .
I would like to stress another principle : ENP should not be limit to cooperation between government and institution .
it have to involve civil society and especially stimulate grass-root exchange between citizen , NGOs and local authority .
therefore , it be important to facilitate efficiently visa requirement for local border traffic and for specific population group .
we also call on the Commission to develop guideline for local and regional authority on their specific role in implement the ENP action plan to develop the ENP further .
finally , in the Regional Development Committee & apos ; s opinion , the ENP should also include cooperation in prevent and deal jointly with natural disaster .
we encourage the Member States to include this aspect in the cross-border cooperation programme .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on civil liberty , Justice and Home Affairs . - Mr President , in these time of globalisation and insecurity about the future , our neighbour need clear sign from the European Union .
they need to hear that we consider them a partner .
they need to know that we support them in their transition towards democracy and a better life .
therefore I welcome the Commission proposal for strengthen the ENP by offer our partner new incentive for reform .
a draftsman of the opinion for the Committee on civil liberty , Justice and Home Affairs , I want to insist on the importance of the ENP a a mean of enforce an area of freedom , security and justice that go beyond our border .
we can not afford to leave our neighbour deal alone with security issue , organise crime and illegal migration .
in today & apos ; s world , each of these phenomenon have a global impact and these challenge be our challenge .
the ENP be ultimately a win-win policy .
build an area of freedom , security and justice be in our mutual interest for the EU and for our neighbour , for the sake of all our people .
I be be tell that the Presidency of the Council have not be inform that the debate be a joint debate on the European neighbourhood Policy and the situation in Georgia .
we shall therefore give Mr Lobo Antunes the opportunity to deal with the latter topic now , with the change of speaker .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) I really do not understand why this debate should cover both neighbourhood policy and Georgia .
we would also like to stress that it be essential for the Government of Georgia to restore confidence in the legitimacy of it action and to do it utmost to ensure respect for the principle of democracy .
from our point of view the current situation remain a cause for concern , but we very much welcome the Georgian Parliament & apos ; s announcement that the state of emergency will be lift on 16 November next , the day after tomorrow .
we hope that this will actually come to fruition rather than simply remain an announcement .
this be an important step towards restore democratic normality in Georgia , since presidential election have be announce for the near future and all the democratic condition necessary for those election to take place must naturally be guarantee .
we be also pleased that dialogue have be establish between the authority and the opposition .
I can inform you that the Council be work with Georgia in exert political and diplomatic pressure to ensure a rapid return to normality .
our Special Representative for the region be active and be currently in Georgia .
I can also inform you that the situation in Georgia will be on the agenda of the next General Affairs and External relation Council .
some three week ago I personally chair an Association Council between the European Union and Georgia , when I be able to highlight the economic progress the country be make and to refer with some hope to the democratic development that we consider to be positive .
we sincerely hope that what be currently happen in Georgia be not a backward step , since that would naturally be highly detrimental to the positive aspect of the development of both the political and the economic situation that we think be encouraging .
I assume that the Georgian people and the Georgian authority be aware of that .
a backward step be neither possible nor acceptable .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner , Minister , I would like to refer to one aspect of the excellent report prepare by our colleague Mr Tannock and Mr Raimon Obiols i Germà .
this be the idea of the EURO-NEST Parliamentary Assembly .
the main purpose of EURO-NEST , a propose in the report , be to put into practice the idea of create a circle of friend of the EU on the parliamentary level and make them friend among themselves .
this be to supplement the policy of neighbourliness pursue by the executive body of the EU .
EURO-NEST would be a parliamentary forum for dialogue , the exchange of experience and multilateral cooperation .
it be not just a matter of strengthen contact between the European Parliament and the national parliament of Ukraine , Moldova , Azerbaijan , Armenia and Georgia , a well a with representative of democratic force in Belarus .
for u , the most important issue be that our neighbour should have dialogue and cooperation among themselves , that they should get to know each other better , develop trust in each other and benefit from the best example of democracy , free speech and respect for human right .
the concept of EURO-NEST be support by the majority of the member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on civil liberty , Justice and Home Affairs .
I would hope that it will also gain the support of all of Parliament .
I would like to address my colleague from the Liberal Group , who submit amendment number 5 , which propose replace EURO-NEST with the exist organisation PABSEC .
I would like to say that PABSEC , the Parliamentary Association on Black Sea Economic cooperation , fulfil a completely different function .
first and foremost there be no role within that organisation for the European Parliament .
thank you to my colleague from the Socialist Group for their understanding .
the compromise formula , replace amendment number 11 and emphasise the need for better intergovernmental cooperation , will make it possible to delineate this form of cooperation in the proper way .
I be convince that EURO-NEST will provide an additional impetus to strengthen partnership with our eastern neighbour and will complement relation with regard to our southern neighbour a part of the Barcelona process .
it will be a signal that , in the European Parliament , we treat our neighbour seriously , and proof that we be strengthen tie with our eastern neighbour , irrespective of party division .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , in the report under consideration there be some important statement and they come at a good time .
the situation in the country to which the report relate ( I be speak mostly about the eastern area ) be a very dynamic one , bring , a can be expect , many new experience .
it be very good that European institution - the Commission , the Council and the European Parliament - be speak with a common voice , a voice that reflect the function for which the institution be create , and for these introductory statement I would like to thank the Commissioner and the Minister .
I would also like to thank the rapporteur .
the Socialist Group in the European Parliament support the development of a European neighbourhood Policy , a strengthened European neighbourhood Policy , provide that it be prudent and effective .
during work on this report we avoid many unnecessary dispute .
we avoid a rather unwise discussion on whether neighbourliness with the East be more important , or neighbourliness with the South .
that would be like ask a child & apos ; who do you love more , your Mummy or your Daddy ? & apos ;
we avoid any unnecessary debate on whether or not a European neighbourhood Policy take the place of a policy aim at EU enlargement .
these , too , be unreal dilemma , but these matter receive clarification .
a European neighbourhood Policy can be effective if it be carry out jointly .
& apos ; Jointly & apos ; mean that it be carry out by the European Union a well a by interested country .
it can not be the same towards all country , because these country have different degree of democracy and be interested in implement this policy in different way .
how delicate a matter this be you have see for yourselves , in observe what take place recently in Georgia , which have just be the subject of discussion .
satisfaction because of another democratic election in Ukraine have be cloud by the fact that these be the second election in two year in that country .
one could say a mixed satisfaction .
a far a the East be concern , our policy relate to an area that be constantly trouble by intrigue organise by the Russian Federation , whether this be obvious or hidden .
finally , a the Minister say , this policy can only be successful if it be accompany by resource , political will , effective action and an absence of naivety , especially if the creation of new institution be involve .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , neighbourhood policy be one of the priority of the EU & apos ; s foreign policy .
the European neighbourhood Policy be part of a wider aim to promote peace , stability and economic prosperity .
the implementation of the ENP also demand much from the EU , a the strategic goal of the 27 Member States have to be able to be compatible .
it be important to avoid east-west confrontation , although , obviously , the Member States of the EU have different priority when it come to cooperation .
cooperation be need in all direction .
a all the EU Member States be involve a well a 16 partner country , it be also understandable that people should have strong misgiving in the development of this policy a to how the different partner country can be include in the collaboration .
the ENP policy & apos ; s strength , however , lie in the fact that it provide the EU with more resource to aid the partner country than would be the case if each country be approach separately and from totally different angle .
the ENP & apos ; s comprehensive approach also ensure that EU policy do not depend on the regional and national predilection of each country to hold the presidency .
my group offer it unambiguous support for the development of the ENP and the priority area highlight by the Commission , which be economic integration , the mobility of people , energy ( to which we would definitely like to add climate change ) , and financial and technical assistance .
( applause )
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , the European neighbourhood Policy gain more impetus at the same time a the last enlargement of the EU .
it now help to encourage neighbouring region to move towards the European value system .
it be the sine qua non for realise objective that be in both side & apos ; interest , that be , a guarantee of security and stability and the promotion of value such a respect for human right and full democracy .
at the same time , within the framework of the European neighbourhood Policy it be worth emphasise the particular significance and identity of country such a , for example , Ukraine .
this country should have a special status within the group of country include in the ENP and should be give priority treatment , first and foremost because of it role in Europe & apos ; s cultural heritage and it historical tie with neighbouring country .
grant Ukraine privileged status be also particularly important because this country have a pivotal role to play in ensure energy stability and security for the whole European Union .
the issue of Ukraine and open the way for it full membership of the EU should therefore be consider on an individual basis , take into consideration that it be Ukraine that be the EU & apos ; s principal partner in the east European neighbourhood .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , I should like to say , firstly , that I be sorry this be a joint debate because the crisis in Georgia ought to have be the subject of a debate in it own right .
last weekend , the President of this House send me to Georgia .
I have just return and I should have like to deliver a report on event there and the various meeting I have .
two minute - sadly - will not be long enough for me to do that .
before talk about Georgia , however , I should like to welcome the latest arrival among the European neighbourhood Policy country , namely Mauritania - a country which I recently visit a head of our election observation mission there .
what be clear today be that the serious crisis in Georgia have certainly put our European neighbourhood Policy to the test .
can this neighbourhood policy be really useful ?
it be now legitimate to ask that question in the light of the situation in Georgia .
what I can tell you , colleague , be that , four year on from the non-violent rise revolution , the community in Georgia be truly shock by the violence of which we saw something on our television screen : the violence direct against Georgia & apos ; s people and the violence use to close down Imedi TV .
they be shock because they do not understand what be go on .
I be therefore grateful to the Commission for call on the Georgian authority to instigate an inquiry - an independent and transparent investigation - because people want to know exactly what happen and how it happen .
we visit the country and , of course , we hear two version of event : the opposition version and the authority & apos ; version .
both be admissible .
it be very clear that two version exist , but people be call for genuine transparency .
obviously we must remember not only , a our colleague remind u , that Georgia be vulnerable - and we do know that - but also that Georgia have to compromise with a & apos ; big brother & apos ; constantly lie in wait to catch it out .
when the Georgian authority draw our attention to Russia & apos ; s omnipresence , we need to consider the sort of thing that happen .
we have an example with our visa facilitation arrangement with Russia , benefit people from Abkhazia and South Ossetia who hold Russian passport , even though these area be part of Georgian territory , and thus place Georgia in an awkward position .
none of this be news to you , Commissioner .
what we must demand today - in addition , obviously , to lifting of the state of emergency - be the immediate restoration of freedom of expression and medium freedom and of course , most importantly , an assurance that there will be free and transparent election .
Georgia today be capable of organise such election .
it demonstrate that just last year when it hold transparent , democratic local election in full accordance with international standard .
it be now time - and I be address the Council here , for I believe it have be somewhat harsh with the Georgian authority - for u , with our European neighbourhood Policy , to demonstrate that we can be useful .
we need to show the people of Georgia that there be some point to the ENP .
the European Union must not let them down .
that be the message we should convey very strongly to the Georgian authority .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , Minister , first I would like to thank Mr Tannock and Mr Obiols for present the report and , without further ado , to inform you that my group be critical of the evolution and approach take in the neighbourhood policy .
there be two clear example towards the West and the south , namely the conflict in the Sahara , to which Mrs Ferrero-Waldner have refer , and the conflict with Israel or , to put it another way , the responsibility of Morocco and the State of Israel for two conflict : the occupied territory of the Western Sahara and the Palestinian conflict .
I sincerely believe that in those area the neighbourhood policy would have to be much more demanding of those two States in order for them to assume responsibility once and for all for conflict which in the one case have be go on for almost a hundred year , and in the other have be in existence for forty or fifty year without have be resolve .
we therefore believe that from that point of view we would have like the European Union to take a much more rigorous position when establish the neighbourhood policy .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , this report clearly demonstrate how the Europhile political elite in this place be completely out of touch with reality and the wish of their constituent .
the report ask for the processing of visa to be urgently improve so that travel from some non-EU state can be make easier and le burdensome .
this be not what most Londoners want .
they do not want to make it easier for people to come to Britain : they want to make it harder .
they want to be more selective of the people we invite to our country , not to extend the current open-door policy .
the report anticipate Ukrainian entry to the EU .
Ukraine have a population of 46 million and , a EU citizen , they would all have the right to enter Britain .
the majority of my constituent do not want million more people give the right of entry to Britain .
they do not want any more indiscriminate immigration from Eastern Europe .
we already have enough immigrant drive around London without tax and insurance ; we have enough criminal , drug dealer , fraudsters , people trafficker and sex slave .
another crackpot idea in this report be the call for a EU neighbourhood Parliamentary Assembly - another talk shop of politician , out of touch with reality , dream up more way of waste taxpayer & apos ; money .
these politician would , of course , need to be handsomely reward for their effort .
it should surprise no one that one of the author of this report be a member of the British Conservative Party , a party that pretend to be eurosceptic at home , but be enthusiastically Europhile here .
no wonder that in London Mr Tannock be know a the Member for Eastern Europe .
I totally oppose these policy ; they damage the interest of my constituent .
that be why I will be re-elected in London in 2009 , and Mr Tannock may not be .
Mr President , recital C of the report say that the European neighbourhood Policy & apos ; should remain distinct from the process of enlargement , whereas participation in the ENP do not preclude , for the eastern neighbour which be clearly identifiable a European country , any perspective of EU membership in the long term & apos ; .
for some reason that rule seem not to apply to Turkey .
here we have precisely the opposite situation .
Turkey be clearly identifiable a a non-European country , be not part of the European neighbourhood Policy , but it do aspire to membership of the EU .
it have never really be clear why Turkey be not include in the ENP .
the Commission say at the outset that a an applicant country Turkey & apos ; s inclusion be not appropriate .
that be odd , because in other case the point be specifically make that the neighbourhood Policy and the enlargement process must remain distinct from one another .
for Turkey clearly a sui generis rule applies .
all this , I fear , have to do with ideological obfuscation .
even assume total commitment to negotiation on Turkish accession , we ought to have include Turkey in the European neighbourhood Policy , if only for reason of prudence .
if the negotiation have to be suspend , a they should have be long ago , Turkey could then have be absorb directly into an existing structure .
it do not happen , and thing will only be more difficult a a result in future .
( PL ) Mr President , after today & apos ; s vote I find out - perhaps it be only I who find this out - that the identity , tradition and sovereignty Group cease to exist at the time that the President of the Parliament announce this information .
however , I note that , accord to the list of debate , this Group do still exist , so I be not at all sure who make the mistake : be it Mr McMillan-Scott when he announce that the Group have cease to exist , or the person who write these list ?
Mr Siwiec , the electronic mechanism have still not be update , but Mr Claeys have not already speak on behalf of a group which cease to exist a couple of hour ago , rather he speak a a Non-Attached Member .
( de ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office , lady and gentleman , I be indeed astonish at the word of Mr Batten , who come from the cosmopolitan United Kingdom and yet be spread narrow-minded and xenophobic propaganda here with his false allegation .
that have nothing to do with the proud tradition of his great country .
the neighbourhood policy have surely become the European Union & apos ; s main instrument of foreign policy now that we be enter more of a consolidation phase follow the accession of twelve country altogether .
for this reason it be important that the instrument of the ENP be use in an appropriate and concentrated manner , and indeed this be clearly be do in some respect .
the neighbourhood policy also give u a solid instrument for active involvement in matter relate to the conflict in the Middle East , a Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner indicate .
I do believe the emergence of solution in Georgia so soon after the outbreak of tension , and the fact that fresh election be to be hold , be partly connect with the effect of the European perspective and the neighbourhood policy , and show that we be on the right track here .
the policy give u the mean to look after our interest , to forge link , to serve the interest of our partner and to foster the development of human right and democracy .
when we discuss Belarus in this context , Commissioner , I find it interesting how we be manage to find a suitable way to link the instrument for human right and democracy in a situation in which the neighbourhood instrument can not yet have the same impact .
that be an important exercise , which we must repeat in the coming year .
we have here an eastern neighbourhood policy and a southern neighbourhood policy .
both be equally important , but the method need not always be the same , because the eastern neighbourhood policy also have this dimension of the European perspective , which mean that there can be different start point and , to a certain extent , different prospect too .
a policy that have to do with association agreement , with partnership and cooperation agreement and with the objective of get a country such a Ukraine into the WTO and then create a free-trade area - with step towards that kind of development - seem to me to be a very important instrument of progress .
this be a policy of joint responsibility .
it be not a matter of the Central European Member States alone look eastward and the Southern Europeans look southward ; the whole European Community be responsible for both part .
for this reason , I have to say that I can not accept proposal such a that for a Mediterranean Union .
I would very much like to see people in Spain and France concern themselves with Ukraine , and Swedes and Germans take the same interest in Morocco .
that , and not a new division of the European Union , must be our policy .
( applause )
( NL ) Mr President , first may I wholeheartedly , on behalf of my Group , echo the appeal which Elmar Brok address to u all just now .
it show how important the neighbourhood policy be to the European Union & apos ; s external activity .
we welcome the plan to strengthen the ENP , but this do not mean that the ENP be the finished article .
the EU must keep look for way of make the policy more effective .
differentiation - a others have say too - be the key to make the neighbourhood policy a success .
the ENP applies to a huge area , from Morocco to Ukraine .
Europe & apos ; s influence be not the same in all these country , and Europe be not equally attractive to all of them .
within the context of the ENP , the EU must offer it partner country the cooperation agreement that best meet it expectation .
this be a give which we think should be reflect in the Commission & apos ; s priority .
Georgia & apos ; s European aspiration be different from those of Azerbaijan .
Tunisia be le important to the EU than Ukraine and Lebanon do not have the same weight a Morocco .
hence the need to consider each country individually .
we must concentrate on those country where the ENP & apos ; s key objective of bring neighbouring country closer to Europe appear the most achievable .
the report also talk about the ENP country & apos ; eastern neighbour .
we think it be a good idea , a part of the recently adopt Central Asia Strategy , to work for solid tie with the country in question .
in so do , the European Union could certainly draw on experience from it neighbourhood policy .
we do not , however , endorse the idea of give country outside the region the status of ENP country .
we would do better to focus on a coherent approach to Central Asia rather than drag certain country into the ENP .
lastly , stronger parliamentary cooperation with the ENP country to the east be only useful if it be accompany by multilateral cooperation by the region & apos ; s government .
if a parliamentary assembly be to be set up , there would also have to be a ministerial assembly , a in other region where we have create parliamentary assembly of this kind .
in our view there could only be a parliament of this kind if the Council and Commission also create an intergovernmental counterpart .
( FR ) Mr President , a rapporteur on the South Caucasus , I should like to use the opportunity of this report by Mr Tannock and Mr Obiols i Germà - whom I congratulate , by the way , on their work - to tell you my impression of the situation in Georgia , base on a visit I make there on 5 November , at the height of the demonstration .
I find it a very complex situation .
the major reform that have be undertake be , on the one hand , impressive , particularly in relation to the economy and to combat corruption ; on the other hand , the difficult social climate have to be bear in mind , with very high unemployment and a third of the population living below the poverty line .
the most striking thing be the very tense , indeed aggressive , political climate , with the opposition level extremely grave accusation at the President , then engage in public retraction that simply raise more question .
the Government respond with repeated accusation of foreign - i.e . Russian - interference , and produce video footage in support of it claim .
the event of 7 November - the declaration of the state of emergency , the violent police crackdown on demonstrator and the closure of the television station - underscore the extremely worrying nature of the situation .
obviously action like this do not sit well in the traditional European framework of value root in the rule of law and fundamental right ; and they need to be explain .
we must hope that the presidential election schedule for 5 January will allow democratic debate to return to the fore .
it will be up to the Georgian people to decide what be rumour and what be fact , and whether to focus on their disappointment or on the challenge ahead .
it will be up to u , however , to encourage them and to assist in the organisation of genuinely democratic , properly conduct election , in accordance with international standard .
the issue at stake be the credibility and stability of democracy in Georgia .
( LV ) lady and gentleman , after the rise revolution , Georgia demonstrate it wish to subscribe to European value .
it expect our understanding and sensitivity .
unfortunately , we have totally ignore this wish .
last year I call for CIs peace-keeping force to be replace by international peace-keepers .
I suggest a review of the legality of issue Russian passport in Abkhazia and South Ossetia , which alter the national make-up of Georgian citizen .
I propose that the Commission and the Council should adopt the same visa facilitation for Georgia that be currently grant in Russia .
however , these call for more active involvement in resolve Georgia & apos ; s problem fell on deaf ear .
this disregard have do much to encourage the current situation .
the path of democratisation and reform often mean internal political crisis , especially in this situation , where they be provide by a large neighbouring state .
the European Union must listen to Georgia and must demonstrate it solidarity through deed a well a word .
thank you .
( de ) Mr President , the official aim of the European neighbourhood policy be to create , and I quote , & apos ; a ring of stable , friendly state & apos ; around the EU .
a very large amount of money be be spend on it - EUR 12 billion for the period from 2007 to 2013 .
for what purpose ?
there have be much talk of human right , but it be all about assert the interest of the EU .
for example , there be talk of establish a free-trade area .
for whose benefit , I ask .
there be a lot about protect border and control migration .
these be thing that we do not support , and so , a my colleague willy Meyer-Pleite have say , our group will not be vote for the report .
( NL ) Mr President , the Commission & apos ; s commitment to the state of Israel under the European neighbourhood Policy be a matter close to my heart .
only yesterday the Commission demonstrate it here in the person of it eminent spokesman Dr Andreas Eldina .
keep it up , Commissioner .
I know I have the backing of our co-rapporteur , Mr Tannock , and of the chairwoman of our Israel delegation , Mrs Hybášková .
I have one burn question to ask .
what specific new possibility do the Commissioner envisage for strengthen the European neighbourhood Policy in regard to Israel , certainly in view of the highly developed political and economic status of the Jewish state ?
in short , be it not altogether appropriate to differentiate here within the European neighbourhood Policy ?
I think it be .
indeed !
( ES ) Mr President , it be very important for our neighbour to be a circle of prosperous , stable , peaceful country where power be base on democratic model and where there be full respect for basic right .
this idea must be a basic premise for the European neighbourhood Policy , a policy which should encourage and help our neighbour to undertake the reform necessary to make the value I refer to above effective .
the issue of political , economic and social reform be , for me , an essential part of the report which we will approve tomorrow .
a second thought be that the neighbourhood policy must have regard to each country & apos ; s specific characteristic .
difference must not be draw on the basis of the continent to which the country belong .
neighbour be just that : neighbour .
that be the important point .
the fact that some of them be also European may have consequence in term of potential accession to the Union , but not for the purpose of neighbourhood policy .
that be a more general assertion with which I agree , because it would be a mistake for u to discriminate against one group of country in favour of another .
there can not be a first-tier neighbourhood policy and another , second-tier , neighbourhood policy .
neighbour on the southern shore of the Mediterranean have note with some apprehension that the enlargement to twenty-seven may lead to a degree of exclusion by the enlarge Union ; a neighbourhood policy which prioritise Eastern Europe or the Caucasus may well fuel that fear .
the southern Mediterranean country have very ancient link to the Union .
they be crucial to u in key field such a security , immigration and energy .
many of our Member States have , a we know , extremely close historic , political , human , cultural and economic link with them .
this , then , be the second major point in my speech .
we should not differentiate between Europeans and non-Europeans in the neighbourhood policy .
the policy must , a Mr Brok have just say , be one of share responsibility .
in view of the above , Mr President , I do not share the doubt express in numbered paragraph two of the report about the meaningfulness of the ENP & apos ; s geographic scope .
moreover , I would not have split the report into two section , one on European neighbour and the other on Mediterranean neighbour .
a single document would have be better .
to close , my congratulation to Mr Tannock and Mr Obiols .
( de ) Mr President , the question be whether development in Georgia show that the neighbourhood policy have fail .
I believe that be not the case .
they show that there may still be a need to raise the profile of the neighbourhood policy , for much of what have happen there be foreseeable .
the fact be that the success and the credit side of the rise revolution in Georgia have be tarnish in recent month and year by a good few authoritarian decision which have encroach on the power of the judiciary .
compound by the social situation , this have result in the recent unrest , and I hope we be now strong enough to ensure , together with President Saakashvili , that a dialogue be initiate and that transparent and free election be conduct with genuine freedom of expression , result in truly democratic choice .
a second reason why the neighbourhood policy need to be strengthen be undoubtedly this whole discussion regard further enlargement .
our intention be now to discuss enlargement to the south-east , to negotiate with the country of south-eastern Europe and Turkey and to bring the process to a conclusion .
this be not the time to anticipate subsequent round of enlargement , but rather to strengthen relation with our neighbour , and some of those neighbouring country , in so far a they be situate in Europe , will have the chance to join the European Union at a later date , though some will not .
this strong link , however , must exist .
the third reason have already be mention .
it be legitimate to envisage an EU-Black Sea community and an EU-Mediterranean community , but it will always be the task of the European Union a a whole to maintain and strengthen relation with these neighbour , a task which also involve support the effort of the Commission .
( HU ) Mr President , the Union & apos ; s objective be to create an area of prosperity , stability and security with it neighbour .
there have already be some serious and solid result in this area , but there have be serious failure too .
there have not be any real progress in the area of frozen conflict , and we do not see any idea for solve the Transnistrian , Abkhazian , Palestinian or Western Saharan crisis .
the country of the neighbourhood policy do not constitute a whole , either geographically , culturally , economically or politically .
this be why a differentiate , country-specific approach be need - it be not certain that what be good for Jordan will be good for Ukraine .
political and budgetary balance need to be create a soon a possible between the eastern and southern dimension of the neighbourhood policy .
however , this must lead to reinforcement of the eastern dimension , since it be an obvious consequence of the fact that the European Union be recently enlarge , with the accession of new Member States .
we have have many promise from the Commission about this , but we be wait for the Commission to keep them .
thank you .
( PL ) Mr President , for the European neighbourhood Policy to be effective , it must be constantly monitor and adapt to the geopolitical situation .
only in this way will it be able effectively to implement the task require of it by the EU .
the European neighbourhood Policy still face considerable challenge .
these challenge consist not only in provide effective assistance for the creation of interstate or economic cooperation .
today it be also of vital importance to have an answer to the question of how we can help to remedy the situation in those country where freedom be under threat .
I be think particularly of Russia and Belarus .
the European neighbourhood Policy must be a tool to exert influence on the authority of those country where political freedom and democracy be no more than a show , where journalist from independent medium lose their life in unexplained circumstance , and where opposition be systematically and often brutally remove from public life .
country that act in this way must be make aware that such practice will be expose and roundly condemn by the European Union .
( HU ) Thank you , Mr President .
the last three year have prove that the European neighbourhood Policy be a very important instrument for ever closer cooperation with the state concern and for increase the stability and security of our Community .
the neighbourhood policy also put u under an obligation , mainly if the fragile system construct up to now in one of the country concern be at risk .
I would like to draw your attention to the situation in Georgia , where the democracy , constitutionality and vigorous economic development that have be build jointly be threaten .
the mass demonstration and riot have make the situation uncertain .
I be convince that the subversive intention of Russian superpower policy lie behind the situation that have develop .
the greatest attention must be pay to strengthen the system of democratic institution .
after the declaration of a state of emergency , or excessive action by the armed force against demonstrator , bring the presidential election forward be the right step in this direction .
Georgia , lead by Saakashvili , be a committed partner to the EU , and despite numerous problem it be show significant progress in the area of reform and economic growth .
the EU , that be , the Commission , the Council and Parliament , in cooperation with the OSCE , have take an interest in resolve this tension use peaceful mean .
we must give all our support to this .
the EU be a & apos ; soft power & apos ; , in other word the method of persuasion through involvement be prove by the Georgian situation , when President Saakashvili drive the intensified process back into the pool of democracy .
I feel it be particularly important to have a systematic review of the effectiveness of the neighbourhood policy in the mirror of the Georgian event .
Georgian power be be put to the test .
in any event , dialogue with the divided opposition , which can not be exclude from this process , be inevitable .
despite our support , Tbilisi must prove how strong the country & apos ; s democratic system be in the January election .
today the Caucasus be the front line of the new cold war , the localised cold war .
upon arrival in Tbilisi , one be greet by a huge image of President Bush and , upon arrival at the border with Ossetia , by a huge image of President Putin , symbolise the new confrontation which we think we have overcome .
what have happen have happen , but it be now our responsibility to use the neighbourhood policy to help ensure that the election in January be free and fair .
it will be difficult .
but such be the fact of the matter .
we , the European Parliament , must be heavily involved and must participate in oversee the election with the OSCE through the observer we must send , because the area concern be the one where most progress towards democracy be at stake in one of the most conflict-torn area in our neighbourhood .
( FI ) Mr President , I too want to thank the author of this report for the excellent job they have do .
I would like to point out how important the role be of local and regional authority and civil society in the implementation of the European neighbourhood Policy .
when we want to promote European value in the neighbouring country , of crucial importance be cultural and student exchange and successful practical project jointly realise .
the Committee on Regional Development be also remind of the excellent experience of the partnership principle in cohesion policy .
these should also be use to advantage when the ENP be be implement .
a genuine sense of rapprochement will also be achieve if the impediment regard border traffic be relax and the movement of student , researcher , artist , journalist , entrepreneur and others be facilitate .
( PL ) Mr President , in speaking of the European neighbourhood Policy we must remember , first of all , to support those government that respect basic freedom and human right , and to encourage those right in country where they be not respect .
this be of fundamental importance for the stability of the European continent .
the list of country include in the ENP be a long one .
I would like to draw your attention to two country , Ukraine and Belarus , which may be include in the ENP .
Ukraine must be a priority for u , and current negotiation with that country should lead to the conclusion of an association agreement and then make it possible for that country to become a member of the EU .
such a policy should provide u with an insurance policy against Russia & apos ; s develop ambition and yet another attempt to make Ukraine a vassal state .
finally , Belarus - the Commission & apos ; s initiative to invite Belarus a an observer to the ENP conference would seem to be premature .
we should bear in mind that this country be still under the dictatorship of Lukashenko , breach human right and the right of ethnic minority .
the EU would do better to provide more effective support for the people and the opposition within Belarus .
a reduction in the cost of visa for Belarussians , and particularly for student , could be a positive signal in this direction , and the Commission should introduce this without delay .
Mr President , I should like first of all to congratulate the Commission on have collaborate on such a unique concept a the ENP .
now finally we have a clear distinction between the enlargement instrument and the ENP .
Europe be in a very peaceful process .
so far it be extremely successful .
the ENP represent a necessary amount of creative thinking which will guard and protect peace and stability for our kid .
energy security , immigration and counter-terrorism be all core issue .
the more clear , precise and analytical and the le political that we be , the better we be equip to face these threat .
allow me , then , to use this particular context and to ask about the legal basis .
some action plan will expire soon .
specifically I point to the EU-Israel action plan , which be due to expire in April 2008 .
the German Presidency create the reflection group .
it main task be to come up with clear work action for the future .
in between , Madam Commissioner , your work , our work , be very positively reflect in Israel itself .
the Council and Commission receive a non-paper reflect on the simple fact that Israel wish to enhance our bilateral relation , to have the EU and Israel meeting annually , to have regular high-level cooperation .
Madam Commissioner , my question be how the Commission will reflect on the Israeli non-paper and especially how will the Commission work on a new action plan ?
how will our new action plan or enhance action plan reflect our concern - counter-terrorism , the fight against extremism , xenophobia , energy security and of course human right issue , a well a international issue , the Geneva Conventions ?
how will all this be reflect and how we will answer the reflection group and the German Presidency ?
Mr President , I be also very concerned about the crisis in Georgia and I have to admit that I be negatively surprised .
recent development be very unfortunate and regrettable for all those who be in favour of the democratic development of Georgia .
the report of organisation such a Amnesty International and Human Rights watch and the Georgian Ombudsman & apos ; s report be very disturb .
give the situation in the country at present , I welcome the statement by the speaker of the Georgian Parliament that the state of emergency will be lift on Friday and that within two day from today normal life will hopefully return to the Georgian citizen .
the situation , in my opinion , undermine the reputation of the Government and also of Mr Saakashvili , who rise to power with peaceful protest in 2003 , and that cast him a the most democratic leader in the Caucasus .
the fact that President Saakashvili have already call presidential election on 5 January 2008 be a positive step that have already help to ease the tension in the country .
but the Government have to hold a democratic and free election in accordance with international standard in order to show to the world that the country be move on .
therefore the Government must guarantee that the election campaign will ensure freedom of expression to all the candidate .
I welcome the dialogue which be take place between the authority and the opposition ; it be a progressive sign .
I also expect and call upon all the party involve to act with responsibility during the whole electoral campaign and to engage constructively in the challenge , which be free and safe democratic election .
( PL ) Mr President , it be vitally important that , in tandem with the neighbourhood policy , the door of the European Union should remain open to our East European neighbour .
membership can be a long-term possibility , a it be dependent on the progress of reform and on compliance with the Copenhagen criterion , but it have great symbolic and political significance .
I know , base on the example of my own country , that the possibility of EU membership alone have the power to mobilise society to take the path of economic reform and democratic change .
today , in the European Parliament , we be send a clear and positive signal to our eastern partner , and now we await their reaction , not only in political declaration , but also , most importantly , in practical economic and social measure .
we expect them to go down the path of reform and democracy , to reform their justice system and make them independent of political influence , to fight corruption and to create a positive environment for economic growth .
I be convince that a democratic and wealthy Ukraine , Moldova and - let & apos ; s hope - one day also Belarus would be good not just for the inhabitant of those country , but also for the whole of the European Union .
( PL ) Mr President , the neighbourhood policy be one of the mechanism aim at support the creation of an area around the EU where cooperation without conflict be possible , a well a avoid the formation of a cultural and economic divide at the EU border .
I agree with the concern express by the author of the report that it would be a mistake to include the country around the Mediterranean in this same policy .
it would be much better to create an EU-Mediterranean partnership with it own proper mechanism .
I believe that only those country that have land frontier with the European Union should be include in the neighbourhood policy .
participation in this policy should be a step to the country in question gain EU membership , obviously only if this be something that the country themselves and the EU want .
in the future we will have to think about the creation of a separate EU-Asia policy for cooperation with country in Asia that want to cooperate economically and politically with the European Union , for example , country such a Georgia and Armenia .
we have to separate our activity by region .
( LT ) We be aware of the fact that the aim of the European neighbourhood Policy be to create a secure circle of safety and stability around the European Union , to develop close relation with neighbouring country a well a to enable these country to implement democratic reform , base on respect for human right , the rule of law and economic and social development .
my question would be this : what price be we prepare to pay to achieve these objective ?
have consider past experience I would like to point out that adequate fund be essential for the development of the European neighbourhood Policy .
in my opinion , EUR 11 billion for a seven-year period for 16 country be not very much .
more efficient coordination of financial instrument and policy be an essential part of improve the funding of the European neighbourhood Policy , and the evolve EU budget reform be an excellent opportunity to lay solid foundation for the much more efficient development of the European neighbourhood Policy in the future .
there be no way I could agree with Mr Pflüger , that it be just a case of squander taxpayer & apos ; money .
the second point I would like to emphasise concern relation among EU neighbour state .
it be essential that they maintain good relation and support one another .
no doubt they would be able to solve most of their problem by work together .
in view of this the European Parliament should express it forthright support of EURO-NEST - the EU Neighbourhood-East Parliamentary Assembly - a well a show political determination and offer financial support for the implementation of this project .
EURO-NEST would provide new momentum for more efficient implementation of the European neighbourhood Policy while substantially increase the parliamentary dimension of this policy , within which the European Parliament would be able to fulfil it honourable mission .
( PT ) The European Union & apos ; s role in the world be now absolutely vital if we be to achieve certain balance which be essential to the pursuit of global peace and justice .
the logic of associate with some country through bilateral agreement in particular must therefore not undermine the development of a multilateral approach that a global vision require of u .
the undeniable influence of universal human right and the guarantee of fundamental freedom in the EU & apos ; s relation with the world must underpin any dialogue with any partner in the world , especially in connection with the Mediterranean region .
because of this region & apos ; s geographic proximity to Europe , it age-old affinity , it cultural diversity and it constant political instability , the EU must act very firmly to ensure those fundamental principle .
I therefore congratulate the rapporteur for the importance they attach to this in their report on the European neighbourhood Policy .
the proposal table by President Sarkozy , meanwhile , on the Mediterranean Union be completely out of context .
although it be extremely useful because it revitalise the debate on the Mediterranean , it propose on the one hand to dismantle the current partnership while , on the other , it disown the EU & apos ; s fundamental principle regard the supremacy of universal human right and fundamental freedom in particular , consider them to be secondary issue accord to a case-by-case pragmatism that would foster a multi-speed relationship .
it be not our role to foster the slow-down our partner take refuge in , or to foster division .
we must promote development and progress , especially in term of right , while always guarantee that we use our investment to provide opportunity for growth and economic development a a whole for the entire region .
guarantee completion of the free trade area in the region in 2010 , among all it peer , be therefore an achievable objective , but we must never abandon our respect for humanist and democratic value and right .
( RO ) I appreciate Mr. Tannock & apos ; s report .
we need neighbour that meet the European Union standard , no matter if and when they become member of the European Union .
for this reason , I believe the neighbourhood Policy should become proactive , namely we should not only monitor the development of the situation , but also support the give country in their effort to meet the required standard .
regard the situation in Georgia , President Saakaşvili & apos ; s decision to organize early presidential election , a referendum for establish parliamentary election and to lift the state of emergency be salutary .
all these action will contribute to the restoration of a democratic climate favourable to resume debate and negotiation for the viable settlement of the sensitive situation in Georgia .
I support the idea of the need to reinstate the mechanism of the rule of law , freedom of expression and freedom of the medium .
I ask all the political force in Georgia to cooperate in order to draw up a law regulate audio-visual activity , which would prevent situation like the recent one .
the party now govern be the one that , begin with 2003 , have initiate and support a coherent system of reform in key field that , in their turn , have generate visible economic development , propel Georgia towards a functional market economy and an authentic democracy .
under the same government , the creation of mechanism for more efficiently actually implement the action plan with the European Union have be support and the evolution towards a European direction have be intensify .
at the same time , Georgia have become a strategic partner in the neighbourhood policy , which be indispensable for solve the frozen conflict in the region , a good mediator , an important partner within regional cooperation and a strategic ally in energy cooperation project and transport .
the claim and attitude of the opposition should be take into consideration , but evaluate in the context of the entire political and economic situation , both internally and in the region .
I believe we should carefully watch what happen in the conflict area in Georgia , a well a the attitude of the Russian Federation , especially in the context of the near deadline for make a decision on Kosovo & apos ; s status .
( FR ) Mr President , I intend to speak specifically about the Mediterranean region which , a the rapporteur have remind u - and I thank them for do so - be very important to Europe in foreign-policy term .
it be my support for substantial European commitment in the Mediterranean region that prompt me to warn against the risk of dilute Europe & apos ; s Mediterranean policy within it overall neighbourhood policy .
we do not want to see rivalry develop between eastern European country and our southern neighbour .
the ENP should bilaterally complement the multilateral Barcelona process , which , I would remind you , have be the framework of reference for structure relation in the Mediterranean region since 1995 .
that be so , neither the ENP nor any other project direct at the Mediterranean country should be allow to obscure or replace the Barcelona objective , base on the three pillar of partnership in political , economic and social development , which be the only way of promote effective regional integration .
I therefore need to highlight two point .
first , we must maintain a balance in apportion funding between the eastern European and the Mediterranean country .
our ability to sustain a strong and ambitious European policy for the Mediterranean region depend on get that balance right .
secondly , with regard to the project Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade area - the subject of my report to the House earlier this year - I would emphasise the importance of a coordinated and gradual approach , enable the country concern to cope with the pace and intensity of an open trading system , while take account of their own specificity and particularly the fragility of some sector of their economy .
trade that serve the cause of development must remain our aim .
in conclusion , I should like to see these aspect address in the report because they be necessary to the definition of a clear Mediterranean policy base on a strategic long-term vision of development and stabilisation in this region .
- ( EL ) Mr President , let me congratulate the rapporteur on their thorough examination of the topic .
however , I must point out that if one of our basic aim be to create an area of peace , we must pay attention to the political future of the country in question .
let me cite Egypt a an example .
do any of u know what will happen in the post-Mubarak era ?
I fear not .
do we not realise that sooner or later Egypt will be take over by the Muslim Brotherhood , a large Islamic extremist organisation ?
we must therefore understand that all our planning in the area will be undermine by such a situation .
I do not want to repeat here , yet again , the proposal I make last year in the previous debate on the report .
I suggest the creation of a commonwealth among these country in order to strengthen relation in the political neighbourhood .
allow me to end by point out that the European political neighbourhood be promote in tandem with the accession of the Ten , with the aim of mitigate the formation of new line of division with neighbouring country .
for this reason , the European political neighbourhood must remain unified , geographically cohesive and balance between it eastern and southern part .
in addition , since the country make up the European political neighbourhood display political , economic and even cultural difference , the principle of diversity be a ever crucially important , but it must not be use to widen the gap between these country .
Mr President , Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner be right at the beginning that the ENP should stimulate democratic reform .
the Georgian Government have to fully restore the normal democratic process in the country and strictly abide by the principle of the rule of law in all it action .
in particular , we should express our concern about the serious violation of the right to free expression and access to information .
what be need in this situation be resume the political dialogue and find a compromise in the interest of the people and democracy in the country .
I be particularly alarm by the violence exert by the police force against peaceful demonstrator .
the event of these last day show failure on the part of the government to bear criticism .
the excuse of the allege plot of a coup d & apos ; état , imply some Russian influence , be highly controversial to say the least .
moreover , it be clear that any successful opposition challenger , whom at this moment we do not see on the political scene , be highly unlikely to be pro-Russian .
we welcome President Saakashvili & apos ; s decision to call early presidential election .
today & apos ; s news that the state of emergency will be lift be also a positive sign .
from now on , we expect that all the necessary condition for free and fair election will be meet .
one of these condition be the freedom of expression , and this mean that all medium that have be forcibly close down during the recent development , like Imedi TV , and Kafkasya TV , should resume their normal activity .
we should be very clear on that .
I believe that President Saakashvili will be bold enough to reverse the negative trend establish over the last week .
after his election he start a good reform policy in Georgia , which have to be support .
I also firmly believe that the democratic development of the country should be closely monitored and support by the European Parliament .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , because of the time I will be very brief , though that be in my favour since I will be present at question time .
this have be a long and intense debate , which I think have cover every essential aspect of the neighbourhood policy .
I also believe that broad consensus have be reach on fundamental issue such a the need for the neighbourhood policy to be a comprehensive and inclusive policy gear towards the North but also towards the East and the South .
it must also take the specific characteristic of the country to which it be address into account .
we must of course take our partner & apos ; specific characteristic and need into account , just a we must also use the necessary instrument in line with those need and specific characteristic .
the European neighbourhood Policy have a single objective which be valid for all the partner , which be to establish a partnership lead them towards economic and social progress and towards strengthen the rule of law and their democracy .
I have to say , however , that in this and other forum I sometimes hear the reflection or indeed suggestion and advice that we should possibly increase the resource and possibly increase the instrument .
these be generous idea that I understand , but we must also be aware that increase the instrument or increase the funding , i.e . the resource , very often simply do not work because our partner country & apos ; absorption capacity be limit .
we would obviously like to see an increase in resource too , but the truth be , a I have say , that our partner & apos ; absorption capacity be very often limited , so give them more financial resource will not make the programme more effective or the result quicker or more visible .
I believe the Commission have make the right choice of area in which partnership should be establish with the country which be in these association with u .
the Commission act in a broad variety of area , include administrative capacity building , reinforcement of the judicial system and the provision of support for civil society organisation and for education and train - a whole gamut of area be cover by this neighbourhood policy .
a I have say , the single and most important objective be obviously for these partner to be able to experience a development which be also in the European Union & apos ; s interest .
the Council will naturally continue to monitor closely the proposal the Commission submits for it approval in connection with the European neighbourhood Policy , and be naturally also always prepare to discuss and debate idea , suggestion and proposal with this Parliament .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I will also try to be a brief a I can .
I will just say that I think it be a very fruitful debate and I wish again to thank the two rapporteur .
it be really clear that a great number of Members want to speak in this very important discussion .
I shall make just a few point in response to some question .
firstly , it be true that Mauritania be now a partner country in the Euromed process , but it be not a neighbourhood Policy country .
I just want to make this clarification ; the fund for Mauritania will still come under the ACP heading .
on my second point , I wish to be very clear .
there be criticism from some Members that human right , democracy and the rule of law be not our major objective .
on the contrary .
if you look at any of the action plan , one of the major part be always a basis for develop a much a possible human right , democracy and the rule of law .
but , of course , it take time and we be work particularly with those country on the question of the judiciary and the justice system , which be , of course , a basis for make difference on the ground .
then one of the Members of the independence / democracy Group say that he do not want to have more migration .
I want to tell him that visa facilitation always go hand-in-hand with readmission agreement , so we be try to combat illegal immigration , but we also want to try to facilitate people-to-people contact and sometimes apply some idea for legal immigration , which be also necessary for many of our country because of the age population .
fourthly , on frozen conflict , of course the neighbourhood Policy alone can not solve all frozen conflict .
for that , we also have special representative of Mr Solana , the Secretary-General of the Council .
but with the neighbourhood Policy we be try to create the best enabling environment for that .
and that be highly important : in Israel and Palestine , when we speak about the Maghreb and when we speak about the country of Eastern Europe .
there be another question with regard to Israel & apos ; s special status .
I can tell you , a I tell the Foreign Minister , Tzipi Livni , when we meet her in Lisbon , that we have a special reflection group .
the reflection group be work .
the idea on the table be very ambitious , particularly from the Israeli side .
but , we have to see that it fit into the overall coherent framework approach of the neighbourhood Policy .
but within that we can certainly do a lot .
and this be what we be reflect on and discuss at the moment .
I imagine that , next year , under the next Association Council , we will hopefully come up with proposal for that .
so we have not forget it ; we be work on it .
a last word on Georgia : many colleague who have speak on Georgia , include my friend Lydie Polfer , have say that the situation be very complex .
we all know that , on the one hand , there be great tension between the opposition and the government , but , on the other hand , there might be also other tendency there .
I therefore think it be highly important that President Saakashvili have call for presidential election .
he have say that he will consult the population on the date for parliamentary election .
and I do hope that the reform aspect that we have really try to promote will go on in the future , otherwise confidence in the Georgian Government will be very much damage if the current crisis can not be solve in a democratic way .
but , of course , we will try to do everything to support Georgia .
my last point be on financing .
many have say that we need more fund .
but you should know that the European Investment Fund or Investment facility that be always mention be an opportunity to give more fund to those country that need them with regard to infrastructure project , energy , transport and so on.We have therefore say that what we have be maybe not sufficient .
therefore , let u have more .
the debate be close .
I would like to remind you that the Raimon Obiols i Germà and Charles Tannock report will be put to the vote tomorrow morning , and that the text submit to close the debate on the Council and Commission statement will be put to the vote in Brussels on 29 November 2007 .
write statement ( Rule 142 )
in write . - a the Chair of the Moldova delegation , I want to thank Mr Tannock for point out that Moldova fully correspond to the criterion necessary for a perspective of membership codify in the Maastricht Treaty & apos ; s Article 49 .
thanks also to his co-rapporteur Mr Obiols i Germà for this balanced and thorough report .
Moldova be not in the neighbourhood of Europe , it be geographically in Europe and should be entitle to join the EU once the three Copenhagen criterion be fulfil .
although the EU-Moldova Action Plan be far from be complete , we must ask what be the next step ?
more incentive be need to motivate our partner in Europe to make painful reform .
to achieve it aim , the financial and other resource of the ENP must be noticeably more generous .
full ESDP mission be need to have a realistic chance of solve the frozen conflict in Transnistria and the Caucasus .
presently there be no resource available to stage those mission .
finally , it be hard to imagine policy which would fit both the country of geographic Europe and the non-European Mediterranean country .
clearly , the scope of the ENP need to be rearrange in the future .
especially it eastern component need better definition .
in write . - ( PT ) I congratulate the rapporteur on their excellent work .
the resolution we approve will consolidate Parliament & apos ; s vision in this area of neighbourhood policy , develop the line we define in January 2006 .
for that very reason it be important to approve amendment 1 and 2 , which I thank Mr Tannock for present .
they reaffirm point we have already approve and that can not be forget now , concern our neighbourly relation on the South Atlantic border .
it be important to recall once again the particular situation of island state neighbour our outermost region - the Canaries , Madeira and the Azores - with which we have historic link and special close tie .
we must also therefore reiterate our request to the Commission to propose and to develop specific policy to expand the European neighbourhood Policy a far a possible to our island neighbour in the Atlantic , close to the European continent , insofar a they highlight not only our geographic proximity but also our cultural and historic affinity and the common interest of mutual security .
along the same line , I would also like to take this opportunity to applaud the recent communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the future of relation between the EU and the Republic of Cape Verde .
question Time ( Council )
the next item be question to the Council ( B6-0382 / 2007 ) .
the following question be present .
subject : & apos ; Revolving door & apos ; immigration policy
some political figure and specialist have raise the possibility of achieve an agreement between the Member States which would combine the monitoring of the Union & apos ; s external border with a new & apos ; revolve door & apos ; immigration policy to allow legally establish immigrant in the Union to return to their country of origin without fear of encounter a closed door when return to the EU .
do the Council consider this approach feasible , and would it be possible to set up this policy use straightforward intergovernmental cooperation , or would it be necessary to establish new institutional mechanism to achieve this end ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) a the honourable Member will know , in May 2007 the Commission present to the European Parliament , to the Council and to the Committee of the Regions a communication on circular migration and mobility partnership between the European Union and third country .
in it communication the Commission considers circular migration to be a useful mean to be develop at Community level to ensure more effective management of migration flow .
in the June 2007 conclusion on extend and enhance the global approach to migration , the Council in turn stress that legal migration opportunity , include well-managed circular migration , could potentially benefit all partner involve .
the Council believe that all well-managed circular migration opportunity should therefore be explore in close cooperation with all the relevant party , with a view to the adoption of Council conclusion not later than the end of 2007 .
the need to examine these circular migration opportunity , base on the Communication from the Commission of 16 May 2007 , be also reiterate in the conclusion of the June 2007 European Council .
the Council be currently examine the issue of the adoption of specific instrument and measure to facilitate circular migration , and the issue of find out how such measure may be implement .
the Commission have not a yet propose any specific measure .
( ES ) Mr President , I believe the Portuguese Presidency be devote a fair amount of attention to this matter , I believe the reply be accurate .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr President , I would like to thank the honourable Member for his kind word .
the presidency be indeed always a little shorter in the second half-year , whether fortunately or unfortunately I be not sure , because of the summer holiday .
we would in fact like to make further significant progress on this matter by the end of the year , but we be also obviously dependent to some extent on the initiative the Commission wish to present to allow u to do so .
that would be our intention and our desire .
at this time I can not guarantee that , however , but if possible and if we have the opportunity , we will certainly take it .
( ES ) Mr President , I share the view of the Presidency of the Council on the revolving door policy for immigration and the new idea on blue card to attract immigrant of high calibre .
I would , however , like to ask the Presidency of the Council if it be convince that we will be able to contain the huge inflow of immigrant to the European Union we have each year , in view of the fact that there be country in the world whose level of development be so poor and so low .
( PT ) The question I would ask on circular immigration be whether there should not be a special mechanism to provide for such immigration , particularly in term of provide training in the country affect .
I be think of doctor and nurse from Malawi who be in the UK , for example .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) In May 2007 the European Parliament and the Council approve three decision : the decision create the European refugee Fund 2008-2013 , the decision create the External border Fund 2007-2013 , and the decision create the European return Fund 2008-2013 .
in June 2007 the Council also approve the decision create the European Fund for the integration of third country national 2007-2013 .
these four decision be an integral part of the general programme & apos ; solidarity and management of Migration flow & apos ; .
in line with the objective lay down by the European Council , the objective of this programme be the fair sharing of responsibility among Member States with regard to the financial burden arise from the introduction of the integrated management of the EU & apos ; s external border and the implementation of common asylum and immigration policy .
the European refugee Fund comply with the obligation set down in Article 63 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the EC Treaty on the adoption of measure promote a balance of effort between Member States in receive and bear the consequence of receive refugee and displaced person .
the Council also seek to promote solidarity by other mean .
that be a comprehensive statement of the theoretical position on burden-sharing .
we know what the instrument be , but I have to ask you candidly , when it come to Malta , Lampedusa and the Canaries , what be the implementation ?
do you feel that , over the last six month , Council member , include those in Western Europe , have take seriously their burden-sharing commitment regard these place , which be in an emergency situation ?
some of our colleague here know it and see it every day .
nobody be identify Portugal a be in any way apathetic on this issue , but what about the Council actively carry out burden-sharing ?
be it be implement ?
please give u your candid response .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) I be very pleased to answer the honourable Member , and obviously I be speak on behalf of the Portuguese Presidency in accordance with it thinking on this issue .
the honourable Member know that migration and migration flow , especially illegal migration flow , particularly from region to the south of Europe , represent a new problem that we do not have to face just a few year ago .
we must obviously , therefore , react to this new and unfamiliar phenomenon and must take appropriate measure .
a be always the case , however , those measure , that reaction and the instrument refer to be take shape gradually , just a our awareness of the importance and gravity of this problem be take shape gradually .
I have to say in this regard that the keyword in this issue for the Portuguese Presidency and for Portugal a a Member State be solidarity .
just a we all understand that when other issue affect one or two Member States they must be see a a problem for everyone , so too in connection with illegal migration the appropriate word be also solidarity , since we be aware that these phenomenon often affect individual States in particular .
it be true that quite often all we do be talk , and it be true that we must and should do more than just talk .
however , the current awareness that the issue concern be a global problem that affect everyone and that be everyone & apos ; s responsibility be a first step .
naturally we be confident that gradually and realistically , but also with the necessary urgency , we can continue to refer to & apos ; solidarity & apos ; while turn it into concrete action and measure .
that be the Presidency & apos ; s role , and that be what Portugal must do a a Member State .
you will also understand that it be not up to a single Member State or a single Presidency to influence all event and all measure , a might perhaps be desire .
but I can assure you that there be a heightened and increasingly strong awareness that we must share that responsibility and give effect to that solidarity .
( MT ) With all due respect , President-in-Office , I be not convince by your reply , a while the Council of Ministers be think about it , there be people drown in the Mediterranean and there be Mediterranean country that can not cope with the emergency ; that be why I be not convince .
I be go to ask you something specific : Malta make a proposal in the Council on the division of the burden , on burden sharing .
it ask that any immigrant save from the sea outside EU water - in Libya & apos ; s water , for example - should be divide among all the EU country .
what be the Council & apos ; s reply , I would like to know .
subject : measure to ensure decent living condition for illegal immigrant , particularly woman and child
which measure do the Council intend to take to ensure that illegal immigrant , particularly woman and child , enjoy decent temporary living condition , so that Member States uniformly respect their international commitment ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr President , I do not know if this be possible or within the regulation , but when the question be introduce I would like to know exactly which of the honourable Members be the author , because obviously my answer will be address firstly to them .
a I be sure you know , the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on common standard and procedure in Member States for return illegally stay third-country national lay down specific rule for the treatment of such national .
Article 13 of the proposal for a directive provide for safeguard a to the condition of stay pending the return of all person cover by the directive .
Article 15 , which establish the condition of temporary custody , define the treatment to be afford to third-country national pending their return .
Article 15 ( 3 ) state that particular attention must be pay to the situation of vulnerable person , and specific provision be make for minor .
a you also know , the European Parliament and the Council be currently examine this proposal for a directive .
- ( EL ) Thank you , Mr President ; allow me to repeat Mr Moraes & apos ; s comment : you be theoretically answer our question very well and in detail .
however , what be the responsibility of the Member States when we do not yet have your analysis ?
be there any international treaty and be they be apply equally to all Member States , or do some Member States , for special reason , provide more or le ?
what be the responsibility of the accession country that serve a transit route for illegal immigrant , mainly woman and child ?
during yesterday & apos ; s sit I mention to the Commissioner that even a 14-year-old illegal transporter of clandestine immigrant have be arrest .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) I have just say that a proposal for a directive be currently under discussion between the Council and the European Parliament in which this issue be address .
since the proposal for a directive have not yet be approve , I can not say exactly what measure the directive will propose for defend and protect the weakest individual who need the most protection .
we shall see .
this proposal for a directive now address that concern to protect the weakest .
I can also clearly tell you that when we , the Portuguese Presidency , refer to the question of illegal immigration , we always say that the fight against it be base on two fundamental principle : solidarity and respect for people and respect for the Humanitarian tragedy underlie the phenomenon .
we should not treat people a object , and neither the Presidency nor Portugal accepts or have ever accept that the Humanitarian dimension should not be consider or should be consider to be secondary in these situation .
this be our position in principle a the Presidency , it be our position in principle a an EU Member State , and it be a position that we will not abandon under any circumstance .
subject : European Security Strategy
what be the result to date of implement the European Security Strategy ?
in particular , what be the result of extend the security zone to include Europe & apos ; s periphery ?
be the Council satisfy with the strategy & apos ; Peace through regional integration & apos ; and & apos ; Regional integration through peace & apos ; on the EU & apos ; s geopolitical perimeter ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr President , honourable Member , in the four year that have elapse since the European Security Strategy be adopt in December 2003 , the European Union & apos ; s foreign and security policy have develop dynamically .
we have react successfully to the threat identify in the European strategy , follow the main thread that inform our approach .
we have have to be more active , more coherent and also more competent .
the new threat of terrorism , the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction , regional conflict , degeneration of the state and organise crime have be meet by many concrete action that reflect the range of instrument currently available to the European Union .
these include diplomatic action , civilian and military mission and trade and development activity .
we have endorse effective multilateralism , support and increase our cooperation with the United Nations in crisis management , the war against terrorism and non-proliferation .
our operation in relation to European security and defence policy be our most visible contribution to global peace and security and demonstrate our willingness to take on global responsibility .
since 2003 we have initiate 16 crisis management operation , four military and 12 civilian , in various part of the world .
these European security and defence policy operation cover three continent and range from purely military operation , include reform of the security sector and institutional development , to police mission to ensure the rule of law .
from Aceh to Ramallah , from Kinshasa to Sarajevo , the EU be put the main catalyst for peace and stability into place .
the pressure on the Union be increase , however .
we have just decide in principle to lead a military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic to help to draw a close to the regional consequence of the Darfur crisis .
we be also prepare to lead a police mission to ensure the rule of law in Kosovo .
from the Western Balkans and from Eastern Europe to the Mediterranean , we have work actively for peace and stability in our neighbourhood use all the mean at our disposal .
- ( EL ) Thank you for your answer , Mr President .
I really feel that the European security strategy be prove more successful in mission outside the European continent than in meeting challenge arise within the EU .
I believe that situation such a that in Kosovo , the management of an emerge crisis , the policy of conditionality in FYROM , a candidate country whose political system be seriously ailing , and the Russophobia , whether justifiable or not , that preoccupy our colleague from the country of the former Eastern Europe - all these challenge u to form a more coherent and effective European security strategy .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) We have just have a discussion here in this plenary session on the European neighbourhood Policy intend precisely for our partner on this continent .
I presume that a general conclusion be that , despite the difficulty that might exist and the improvement that could be introduce , this European neighbourhood Policy that form part of our strategy have work well and have ensure that many of our partner and neighbour can enjoy stability , economic progress and economic and social development .
for well-known historical reason , many of our partner be naturally now experience what could be call stage of transition , democratic consolidation and consolidation of the rule of law , and a be so often the case , these process be not exempt from difficulty , upheaval or problem .
and this be perhaps true of some of those country .
we recently speak about Georgia , when I say here that I chair the Association Council with Georgia some three week ago and have the opportunity to inform our Georgian colleague that in the area of the economy , for example , we be pleased to note that significant progress have be make in term of economic development , despite the problem that country have with Russia .
we must therefore be prepare for the significant progress that we expect and want , but for well-known reason we must also sometimes expect backward step that we sincerely hope will only be temporary , and we hope that the States and country will rapidly return to progress and towards reinforce the rule of law .
I must therefore tell the honourable Member in all sincerity that , although we European Union citizen sometimes tend to be very modest with regard to the capacity of our achievement and to the achievement themselves , we must be a little more friendly towards ourselves , a it be .
I think that we have achieve something despite the difficulty .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) a the honourable Member know , the Council do not comment on speech by Heads of State of European Union Member States .
naturally , however , I have note President Sarkozy & apos ; s opinion , which be that of the head of State of a very important EU Member State .
I do not have a crystal ball and therefore can not tell you how far this idea will go .
we shall see , but since it be a proposal from President Sarkozy , it will obviously be listen to very attentively , like all his proposal .
subject : accession negotiation with Macedonia
what be the Council & apos ; s assessment of the stage reach in bring Macedonia closer to the EU , and when do it consider that it will be possible or desirable to set a date for start accession negotiation ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr President , honourable Member , the December 2005 European Council decision to grant candidate country status to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia be recognition of that country & apos ; s reform achievement .
in it interim report the Commission have examine development in detail .
follow the assessment of the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , a set out in the Commission report of 2006 , in it session of 11-12 December 2006 the Council regret that the pace of reform observe have slow down in 2006 .
on 14-15 December 2006 the European Council reiterate that each country & apos ; s progress towards the Union would continue to depend on it effort to comply with the Copenhagen criterion and the conditionality of the stabilisation and Association process .
the Council call for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to accelerate the pace of reform in key area and to implement the priority identify in the European partnership in order to move ahead in the accession process .
the fourth meeting of the stabilisation and Association Council between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia take place on 24 July last .
particularly important among the message set out in the Union & apos ; s common position for the stabilisation and Association Council be it insistence that stability and the regular functioning of democratic institution be fundamental aspect of the political criterion essential for ensure progress towards European integration .
institution such a the Government , Parliament and the President must function and cooperate effectively .
they must also play their differentiated role and interact a lay down in the Constitution .
a constructive political climate must be establish and maintain so that the country can concentrate on the reform necessary to make progress towards the Union .
further effort must also be make to establish confidence between the ethnic community at all level .
the Union recall that sustain implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement be a key element of the political criterion .
every effort must be make to achieve the broadest possible political agreement on the associated reform , in full compliance with the letter and spirit of the agreement .
the meeting also recall the importance of make progress in the area of justice and internal affair , particularly in combat organise crime and corruption .
at the same time the Council also recall that regional cooperation and good neighbourly relation be an essential part of the process of EU integration .
finally , I wish to state that the Council be examine very carefully the Commission report publish on 6 November , which will be the subject of conclusion at the General Affairs and External relation Council in December next .
( de ) Thank you , Mr President-in-Office , for your very comprehensive reply .
I have only two brief supplementary question .
firstly , do you think it conceivable that a date for the opening of accession negotiation will be set in the course of next year ?
Macedonia & apos ; s applicant status date from more than two year ago , and it be surely high time to think about a date .
my second supplementary question be this : what approach be be adopt ?
be attempt be make to link Macedonia & apos ; s accession with that of other country , such a Serbia , or be this country really be deal with separately from any others ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) a the honourable Member will understand , I can not say whether we be or be not in a position to set a date in the coming year for start accession negotiation with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
difficult and demanding condition and criterion must be meet before such negotiation can begin , so the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be further from or closer to be inform of the date for start negotiation accord to how far it meet those criterion and condition .
what I would say , however , be that the candidate country will be better place to answer that question than the European Union .
a regard connect accession process , the Presidency maintains and have always maintain that each candidate State must be judge separately on it own merit .
if the candidate State be eligible because it meet the commitment and condition for start accession negotiation , it should be grant that status irrespective of what might happen in parallel process involve other candidate States .
subject : tiger conservation
what have the EU do , and what further measure be under consideration , in order to encourage and assist India and other relevant country in the conservation of their tiger population in a way that involve local people and give them a stake in the protection of those animal population ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr President , honourable Member , the Convention on International Trade in Endangered specie of Wild fauna and flora , or CITES , provide the international legal framework for the conservation of tiger and other endangered specie .
the EU and it Member States be strong supporter of CITES , both politically and financially .
in recent year the EU have lay particular stress on the need for greater concentration of effort in the practical application of CITES control in order to reduce illegal slaughter and trade and to guarantee sustainable trade of specie .
to underscore this need , the Commission publish recommendation No 207 / 425 / EC of 13 July 2007 , identify a set of action for the enforcement of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 338 / 97 on the protection of specie of wild fauna and flora by regulate trade therein .
meanwhile , the specie & apos ; pantera tigris & apos ; be list in Annex A of Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 1332 / 2005 of 9 August 2005 , and be also list in Annex I of CITES , which mean that specimen of that specie can only be move in exceptional circumstance , subject to rigorous criterion .
if those criterion be to be meet and any decision to authorise trade be to be possible , assurance must be forthcoming that the activity be not detrimental to the state of conservation of the specie .
we would also draw your attention to the need for international cooperation and in particular for capacity building to facilitate the implementation of policy for the conservation and sustainable use of wild flora and fauna in States where such specie be find .
the EU thus support the decision relate to Asian big cat , approve at the 14th meeting of the party to CITES at the beginning of this year , with the aim of intensify application and conservation effort .
we be , furthermore , also prepare to provide assistance to India and to the other States of the distribution area in implement these decision .
we recognise that the effective implementation of conservation measure require the participation of the local population .
we have stress the need , through CITES , to ensure the support and cooperation of local and rural community in manage wild fauna and flora resource , and consequently in combat illegal trade in them .
I thank the Presidency very much for that , and I will read the document mention .
however , the problem be that the situation regard tiger be a crisis .
there be probably only 3000 leave in the wild .
they could be extinct in the wild by 2020 .
the main problem be poach , which be drive by the lucrative illegal trade in tiger skin and part , say to stretch to Eastern Europe .
the Indian forestry authority say they be unable to cope with poaching gang , due to chronic underfunding .
can the EU help with that ?
have we get specific project ?
a Chinese official say recently that it be very hard to resist pressure to open the tiger trade .
surely the key be education on the one hand , but also give local people an economic stake in maintain higher level .
what be the EU actually do in term of specific project ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) The honourable Member will note that I have refer extensively , at length and in detail to the international legal and judicial framework in which the European Union exists and operate .
I have also naturally express the Council & apos ; s willingness , readiness and commitment to do it utmost within that international framework to ensure that the measure it provide for be effectively apply .
I have also say very transparently that we also recognise that we must work together with local population that have direct contact with those endanger specie .
the battle against poach and similar illegal activity be not an easy one , a people with experience of these situation know .
they be aware that it be a difficult yet necessary battle , an assessment with which I agree .
the whole of European public opinion be with you , because what have be see recently in connection with the illegal trade in endangered specie show that people be much more aware of the need to draw attention to these issue than they use to be .
the pressure of public opinion and the attention pay to it in connection with these situation be therefore now much greater than it be .
you can therefore obviously count on that public awareness , which be also necessary to ensure that we , the EU , and our Member States be able to act more effectively .
a I say , we must recognise that it be a difficult battle .
Mr President-in-Office , you have make it very clear that you and the Council a a whole be commit to the protection and conservation of the tiger .
the Indian Prime Minister equally have , in a number of statement , make his passionate commitment to defend the tiger clear .
a we be engage in a bilateral negotiation with India to create a new bilateral treaty between the EU and India , do you think this be a subject we could include in that treaty and that we could go beyond our current commitment under CITES to help with education , training , conservation - the sort of measure that Baroness Ludford be talk about ?
( de ) Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , my question have to do with this issue but relate to a slightly different aspect .
I believe - and you rightly refer to this - that question such a the one under discussion arouse strong feeling among the general public .
on the other hand - and you also refer to the legal position - be we in the European Union really justify in arrogate legislative or contractual power to ourselves on every issue that deeply concern anyone in the EU ?
or should we not exercise a little restraint in these matter ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) very well , I must confess , Mr President , that I do not fully understand the second question , perhaps because of delay in the interpreting .
a regard the question of the tiger and dialogue with India , I must say in all sincerity and frankness that it be a specific question , on which I have not reflect , but on which we will reflect in the future , and I therefore take note of the honourable Member & apos ; s suggestion .
in our bilateral dialogue with India - an EU-India Summit be to be hold - we may also discuss this issue of protected specie and how we can better protect endangered specie .
I must confess that because of the interpreting , I believe , I could not understand your second question .
( de ) Thank you very much , and my apology for have speak so quickly .
I be consciously try to avoid overrunning .
I mean it be important that we deal with such concern when they matter to the people of Europe .
on the other hand , we should also be aware of the legal limit of the Union and take care to respect these limit a far a we can .
the approach you have propose seem interesting , but we should not leave ourselves open to the accusation that the Union be claim competence for all global matter .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) I agree with the honourable Member , the European Union can not and should not be responsible for everything , and should not be accuse of or judge for everything .
accord to the Treaties , many of those aspect and responsibility lie with the Member States , and in this case may be responsibility both of the Member States and of the States in which these situation occur .
the European Union be not and can not be a universal panacea , particularly since there be a principle , the principle of subsidiarity , that must always be respect .
subject : non-EU financial service centre
will the Council make a statement on how it engage with non-EU financial service centre on area of mutual concern ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr President , honourable Member , in the conclusion adopt in May 2006 , the Council welcome the Commission & apos ; s White Paper on financial service policy from 2005 to 2010 .
the Council particularly welcome , and I quote : & apos ; the idea put forward with respect to the grow importance of the external dimension in financial service - namely to deepen and widen regulatory dialogue with third country and work towards the further opening of global financial service market & apos ; .
on the Portuguese Presidency & apos ; s initiative , on 9 October last the Ecofin Council examine the state of play regard macroeconomic , financial and regulatory dialogue with the Union & apos ; s principal partner - the United States , Japan , Russia , India and China .
the importance of these strategic dialogue be stress during the discussion .
such dialogue make it possible to reinforce convergence , cooperation and mutual understanding between global partner , thereby help to facilitate access to the respective market and to promote macroeconomic and financial stability , particularly in financial service .
the dialogue have lead to significant progress concern convergence and equivalence of accounting standard .
the Council support the work carry out by the Commission , and considers that financial market globalisation require increase effort to achieve convergence and cooperation at international level , in line with the Commission and the Council & apos ; s strategic vision on the need to reinforce the Lisbon Strategy & apos ; s external dimension through the promotion of and an international approach to regulatory cooperation and the convergence and equivalence of standard .
stress be also lay on how important it be for the European Union to ensure a coherent approach in this area , and it be consider that information on the development of such dialogue should continue to be forward to the Council on a regular basis .
I would like to thank the Council Presidency for it reply .
be this Council Presidency aware that there be a school of thought that say that the developing world could greatly benefit from have a financial service sector ?
give Portugal & apos ; s experience in Africa in particular , could I ask the Council President , if he do not have the response there in his brief , if he would cause this issue to be examine and pursue , because it may well be a way of assist not just the developing world but in have global interchange , which would be of great benefit to this part of the world a well .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) The honourable Member be right , I do not have a write answer in my brief to give you , but I will give you my opinion .
in this respect we have a very interesting discussion this morning on globalisation , when we also discuss financial service and question relate to the turbulence on some financial market .
in this context , therefore , the financial or other instrument , initiative or mechanism that could actually put Africa with all of u , with the European Union and with other major emerge bloc , on the agenda of the talk , debate and theme of globalisation can only be welcome .
thank you , President and President-in-Office for be on overtime a we all be ; we appreciate that .
what do you think be the obstacle to greater progress in this area , and do you think that , a thing stand , enough be be do ?
because what we be talk about be consumer confidence in the financial service sector , both within Europe and outside .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) This issue , the conduct of these dialogue and so on in this specific area , which be part of the question I be ask , have be direct by and be the responsibility of the Commission .
I also have to confess that I be not a financial specialist and therefore do not have the detailed knowledge require to give you a technical answer .
you be ask for a technical answer and I can not give you one .
I can give you a political answer that will outline a new reality , a new problem and a new challenge , but also a new opportunity .
this problem should be and have now be examine and have be develop to an unprecedented extent .
we in the European Union too must naturally seek appropriate answer when problem arise , and the necessary instrument must also be at our disposal when it be a case of develop and make progress .
I can not tell you specifically what obstacle may have arise or may arise , though I can give you an idea , a I have , of what the EU & apos ; s policy and the Council & apos ; s responsibility in this field have be .
finally , I can say that it give me great pleasure to be able to extend my stay here with you , particularly since this mandate be come to an end .
I only have one more opportunity to be with you , so I must make the most of this experience .
question which have not be answer for lack of time will receive write answer ( see Annex ) .
question time be close .

trade and economic relation with Ukraine ( debate )
the next item be the report by Zbigniew Zaleski , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on trade and economic relation with Ukraine .
rapporteur . - ( PL ) The report illustrate the role that we envisage for Ukraine against the background of our own economic activity a well a a a partner in the context of trade with other country .
in addition we want to emphasise the role that Ukraine play in the Black Sea region , that be , it political , economic and cultural role .
I believe that economic activity and development should progress irrespective of the political idea hold by a country .
the economy must be free , state and legislative authority should provide support , individual businessmen and group of entrepreneur should constitute economic entity .
the economy should be an instrument to bring good living condition to the citizen , and this objective can be achieve by raise living standard , improve work condition , through good education , a good justice system , include ownership right .
we can not allow common property to be use for individual gain .
encouragement should be give , also motivation , for people to work honestly to bring material and other personal benefit .
if one do not have one & apos ; s own good model or history , it be worth take advantage of others & apos ; good practice and experience , those of one & apos ; s neighbour .
for this reason it be important to include Ukraine in the common market and make the know-how develop in the EU available to it .
I believe that our economic model be good , even though it be far from perfect , for example with regard to production and trade in food , but we be make constant effort to improve ourselves .
we can offer to our neighbour from the other side of the River bug the standard and rule that we have find to work .
what do the report cover ?
it cover industry , agriculture , energy , finance , border guard , transport infrastructure , example of non-corrupt activity , intellectual property , the natural environment , scientific cooperation and relation with neighbour .
these be part of a single whole that we call the economy .
there be well-defined standard that form the basis of that economy and , in the report , we recommend that our partner develop such standard for themselves or abide by them .
what condition do Ukraine have to fulfil in order to negotiate better link with the European Union ?
a essential condition , I believe , first of all , join the World Trade Organization and , while so do or even before , resolve the debt problem with Kyrgyzstan .
this process be already under way .
secondly , approval of membership by the Ukrainian Parliament a quickly a possible .
other condition include good relation with it neighbour , that be , with Russia and Belarus , stability in it currency , the quality of financial service , develop brand in international market and keep to the letter of the law .
Ukraine , which have declare it desire to join the European Union , face great , even enormous , challenge .
namely , convince Europe by it economic , legal , financial and political activity that it be a sufficiently commit partner for the EU to ask itself , sooner or later , would it not be worthwhile to include Ukraine in the common European entity ?
Commissioner , our approach may sometimes have be different , but I believe that we have the same objective , which be to develop a beneficial modus vivendi , a way to coexist with this important eastern neighbour .
I think , Mr President , that I have save some time a it be already even .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first of all let me congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Zaleski , on this very good report .
I also want to thank the rapporteur for the excellent cooperation with the Commission service when draft this report .
the report be very timely .
it provide a comprehensive overview of the issue at stake in EU-Ukraine economic and trade relation .
allow me to focus on some point that you also highlight in your report .
we consider Ukraine a key and valuable partner in our neighbourhood strategy .
we agree with the general spirit of the present report : to bring Ukraine & apos ; s economy a close a possible to the EU by mean of a new enhanced agreement , of which the deep and comprehensive free trade agreement will be a key pillar .
the Commission also fully share your view concern the need to strengthen the rule of law in Ukraine and the importance of Ukraine & apos ; s accession to the WTO .
we strongly hope that Ukraine can still complete the WTO accession process this year , and we will cooperate closely with the Ukrainian Government to this end .
we consider that , once the accession package have be approve by the member of the WTO , the multilateral process of accession will have be complete .
Ukraine have set WTO accession a it priority and we be convince that it will duly carry out it internal ratification procedure to formalise it membership .
the European Union have no interest in further delay the launch of FTA negotiation and be ready to start a soon a the decision on the accession package have be approve by the member of the WTO .
concern the future FTA , we completely agree that it should be deep and comprehensive , with a strong focus on regulatory alignment .
a for economic relation with neighbouring country , the report suggest a three-way dialogue : EU-Russia-Ukraine .
we should be very prudent not to duplicate process on topic already cover in other forum .
furthermore , the question arise a to whether the European Union would not risk be draw into bilateral dispute between Russia and Ukraine .
we would also question the benefit of such an approach .
it be our policy to favour the opening-up of energy market to competition a a mean of ensure access to secure and affordable energy .
this will be an important subject in the future FTA negotiation with Ukraine .
a for concern on safeguard the basic need of the population , EU legislation on the liberalisation of the electricity and gas sector include significant provision with the scope to ensure protection of consumer and to safeguard their basic need .
we intend to negotiate Ukraine & apos ; s alignment with this legislation .
concern the suggestion to extend the GSP + to Ukraine , I would like to underline that Ukraine do not qualify for these additional Preferences and that the European Union have commit itself not to amend the basic GSP criterion on an ad hoc basis .
in addition , this would severely undermine our negotiate position for the future FTA .
in conclusion , allow me to once again congratulate the rapporteur on his good report .
the Commission widely share it general approach , except on the few issue that I have underline above .
the Commission will take the report into account in it ongoing and future cooperation with Ukraine .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , although the post-electoral situation in Ukraine have not yet stabilise , those who represent democracy have win .
this be a victory not just for democracy in Ukraine , but also for the European Union itself , which support this kind of activity .
now , in the interest of Ukraine , the Ukrainians and the European Union , we must consolidate what have be achieve with such great difficulty in Ukraine .
it be the Ukrainians themselves who have to take the post-electoral decision , but we can help Ukraine and , at the same time , help ourselves .
I fully support Mr Zaleski & apos ; s report , and congratulate him on prepare such a document .
in my opinion there be three area that be most important a regard bring stability to Ukraine and also benefit to the European Union .
firstly , energy cooperation , which be very important for both side .
it be essential that we become involve in investment in pipeline that be in many case in poor condition , a also in new pipeline , such a the one from Odessa - Brody - Gdańsk , in investment in the electricity grid and in support energy efficiency .
we can offer our own technology , we can create joint capital to improve energy efficiency in Ukraine , and this will also help our own energy security .
finally , something which be obvious , improvement in nuclear power station safety in Ukraine , which be very important for Europe .
the second area be scientific cooperation .
Ukraine have considerable achievement in this area .
it be worth benefit from them .
in addition , exchange of student and scientist , which could reduce the deficit in the European Union , where we be short of seven hundred thousand scientist .
we should bear in mind that this be always the surest and fastest method of cooperation : science , educational institution and student .
thirdly , cooperation between local and regional government .
our EU town have a great deal to offer in this regard .
we could assist in create full democracy on the level of local government in Ukraine , which be something that have not happen so far .
all this should be make part of a long-term aim , namely an association agreement with Ukraine .
it do not matter whether it take 10 year or 20 .
it be worth present Ukraine with this opportunity .
it will help Ukrainians , and it will help the European Union .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , in plenary this afternoon we debate the European neighbourhood policy .
follow the enlargement round of 2004 , the European Commission propose the development of a coherent strategy towards the Union & apos ; s new neighbour .
the ENP have create special link with a ring of country that share the EU & apos ; s fundamental value and aim .
our neighbour Ukraine be firmly embed in the ENP .
we be aware of the special geopolitical and commercial importance of Ukraine a a natural bridge between the EU on the one hand and Russia and Central Asia on the other .
today the EU be Ukraine & apos ; s main trading partner ; by 2006 , the volume of trade between Ukraine and the Member States of the EU have already reach EUR 26.6 billion .
we in the European Union acknowledge the great effort that have be make in Ukraine in recent year .
the former command economy have be develop into an efficient market economy .
accord to the OECD report , Ukraine & apos ; s economic growth average 7.6 % in the year from 2000 to 2006 .
that be a great success .
in February 2007 we begin negotiation on a new partnership and association agreement between Ukraine and the EU .
the Ukrainian aspiration to EU and NATO membership be also well document .
for reason of trade and economic policy , accession to the World Trade Organization be at the very top of the Ukrainian agenda .
we assume that accession to the WTO will prove possible before the end of this year .
this would also considerably broaden the scope for cooperation between the EU and Ukraine and smooth the way for negotiation on the creation of a free-trade area in the ENP framework .
the EU must treat Ukraine a a genuine partner and give it clear message .
in this respect I can only welcome the outcome of the EU-Ukraine summit hold in Kiev on 14 September 2007 , where the strong and endure relationship between the two party be reaffirm .
we should continue to lend vigorous support to Ukraine on it path to WTO membership , in the subsequent creation of a free-trade area , and with regard to it European aspiration .
Ukraine be a strategically and economically significant EU partner and an Eastern neighbour with an important role within and outside the region .
relation between the EU and Ukraine have mainly develop in the direction of increase political cooperation and gradually increase economic integration .
the implementation of these objective would contribute towards the further consolidation of democracy and the development of the market economy in Ukraine .
however , the success of Ukraine & apos ; s development do not depend solely on the EU .
Ukraine must make a forthright decision to follow the pro-Western direction and follow it consistently .
I would like to share some thought about economic and trade relation between the EU and Ukraine .
first of all , the start of negotiation for a free trade area with the EU be strictly link to Ukraine & apos ; s membership of the WTO .
however , negotiation on the-free trade area would cover not just the abolition of tariff ( which be include in the negotiation with the WTO ) , but the more extensive convergence - the liberalisation of the service sector , institutional reform , the harmonisation of the legal basis with the EU acquis .
accordingly , coordinate action between the EU and Ukraine with a view to create the free-trade area should develop alongside Ukraine & apos ; s membership of the WTO .
secondly , more attention should be pay to the implementation of good management practice , the intensification of the public sector and the curbing of corruption .
more intense cooperation in these area would contribute significantly towards establish more stable economic and trade relation between the EU and Ukraine a well a strengthen the process of democratisation and increase the prospect of Ukraine & apos ; s membership of the EU .
thirdly , it be important to point out the fact that Ukraine & apos ; s producer be not yet ready to compete with the producer of EU Member States .
therefore , transitional period should be establish , a well a supervisory institution in order to safeguard against the negative impact on the Ukrainian economy and society .
the fourth point be that while the EU support the liberalisation of trade with Ukraine , it must be prepare for possible difficulty arise from Ukraine & apos ; s producer , especially those involve in export to the CIs ; resistance to implementation of EU standard ; attempt by functionary to maintain the status quo and exist corruptive tie .
to facilitate successful implementation of the reform the Ukrainian Government should inform business people and the public about the advantage of the liberalisation of trade and a free-trade area between the EU and Ukraine .
the fifth point be that the intensive development of relation between the EU and Ukraine can potentially increase Russia & apos ; s political and economic pressure on Ukraine .
in that case the EU should abandon it role of passive arbitrator , a have happen quite often before , and take on the role of defender of it own interest and those of Ukraine .
there be a possibility that Russia could apply pressure on Ukraine and certain EU country in the sphere of energy supply .
therefore , the EU should not only make an effort to solve these problem at the highest level , but also , at the same time , seek Ukraine & apos ; s involvement in the EU common energy market and ensure the security of EU and Ukrainian energy security .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( LV ) The report provide an overview of the current development of Ukraine , a an EU partner , and the task it still have to carry out , and it deserve praise for the number of issue cover and the depth with which they be assess .
it be apparent from the report that the author have a deep , personal interest in Ukrainian development issue and in the shaping of it relation with the European Union , and this have of course benefit the report .
the rapporteur have carefully and considerately assess the problem pose a threat to the successful development of Ukraine , but at the same time , if we do not call a spade a spade , it be sometimes difficult to anticipate solution to problem .
it can not go unremarked that in Ukraine & apos ; s economy increase number of economic sector be over-regulated , state intervention be not base on law and there be a continual increase in the creation of mutually incompatible legislation , which benefit those seek loophole in law and those whose job it be to interpret legislation .
together with the high level of bureaucracy , this significantly hamper the influx of investment into the country & apos ; s economy , include that from the European Union .
the energy sector be an obvious example of this .
the European Union be interested in a transparent transport system for Ukraine & apos ; s natural gas , which , like the entire energy sector in Ukraine , be over-regulated , with artificially complex structure and flow of money that be not transparent .
the European Union still do not have the data to allow it to assess the safety of Ukraine & apos ; s gas transport system .
these be important issue for the European Union , which be Ukraine & apos ; s largest trading partner .
it be to be hop that Ukraine will manage to overcome the protracted political crisis and that the Ukrainian Government will in future be involve in EU talk that , on the basis of mutual interest , will make it possible to establish close cooperation .
I agree with the rapporteur that Ukraine & apos ; s wish to join the European Union can not be ignore , and here I would like to stress this once again : a clear prospect of EU membership be the most effective reform tool that the European Union can offer Ukraine .
thank you .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Zaleski very warmly on his report .
I think it be a significantly different kind of report to recent one which have be vote on in the Committee on International Trade .
compare to the report on bilateral trade relation of one or two year ago , like the EU-Russia or EU-Mercosur report , it show a lot more cautiousness with regard to the benefit of unfettered free trade .
and I think it indicate a grow consensus across the party spectrum on the importance of actively engage in a political search for how best to submit trade rule to the principle of sustainable development .
in that respect , I think we can be please that we have make the most of the various delay at the WTO Doha Round , which , in a way , have allow u to conduct this search for more fair and sustainable trade rule in our bilateral trade relation .
I therefore thank the rapporteur for actively seize this opportunity .
among the many positive signal that this report give to DG Trade for their negotiation with Ukraine on a free trade agreement , I would like to highlight four point in particular .
in paragraph 10 , I think the report rightly warn against rely exclusively on export orientation and export diversification in order to make trade sustainable .
instead , it focus on the importance of develop the domestic market a a necessary basis for any economically sustainable development .
in paragraph 13 , the report suggest the need to strike a balance with regard to investor & apos ; right .
in other word , it insist on a legal framework in Ukraine which foster best practice in corporate social responsibility .
in paragraph 23 , the report suggest a significant shift in our foreign energy supply policy by ask for multilateral rule regard access to energy resource and by warn not to support the race for the best condition for unilateral energy access .
finally , in paragraph 36 the report recognise that agriculture be a special activity that can not be treat in the same way a industrial good and therefore justifies different tariff rule .
I very much hope that those and other point remain in the final text so that my group can very happily vote in favour of the report .
but I do just want to add that I think it be a pity to hear that DG Trade have be object to three key amendment propose by the Greens and support by the rapporteur , which call on DG Trade to start negotiation for a bilateral FTA only after the Parliament of Ukraine have give it assent to the WTO accession negotiation .
while DG Trade be certainly right that this might delay the bilateral FTA , we have to insist a parliamentarian , a we do ourselves before the conclusion of such FTAs on the part of the European Union , for the voice of the people to be take into account on such an important matter and that include , of course , the people of Ukraine .
we would therefore especially like to thank Mr Zaleski for not give in to that pressure and , once again , for an excellent report .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , everyone have thank our honourable colleague Mr Zaleski , and I shall do likewise .
his report be adopt in committee without a single dissenting vote , which show that we can indeed produce a cross-party report if we try hard enough .
allow me to make a few remark .
the Ukrainian election have take place .
they be democratic , they be fair and they be free , but I believe they have leave a host of problem unresolved .
the incumbent President have always have difficulty in his dealing with strong prime minister , whether with Yulia Tymoshenko , whom he dismiss in 2005 , or with Viktor Yanukovych in 2006 and 2007 .
although the coalition agreement conclude between Yulia Tymoshenko & apos ; s alliance and the our Ukraine bloc exists on paper a the basis of a possible new government constellation , the government have not yet be form .
nor do we know what will actually transpire , even though the deadline be now quite close .
if this government be form by then , it first task , in my view , be to tackle constitutional reform , for without reform of the Constitution there be no guarantee that the internal stability of the political force in Ukraine will suffice to avoid another fresh set of election , especially a some people be already think about call for new parliamentary election at the time of the presidential election .
if you look at certain area , such a economic policy , the OECD report paint a truly encouraging picture .
it tell u that Ukraine record average GDP growth of 8.7 % between 2000 and 2006 .
if you look behind these figure , however , you will see a huge trade deficit .
Ukraine have a deficit of more than EUR 4.5 billion in it trade with the country of the CIs and a deficit of almost EUR 4.5 billion with the European Union .
in other word , there be still a real need for economic change , and the partnership agreement can and must be use for that purpose .
on the other hand , compare with the statistic of a country such a my own - the Federal Republic of Germany - the Ukrainian figure do seem magnificent .
Ukraine & apos ; s unemployment rate be lower , it GDP be grow faster , it welfare expenditure on pension be higher , and it spend a higher percentage of it GDP on education , and hence on investment in the future , than the Federal Republic of Germany .
there be therefore every reason to conclude that the country be unquestionably on the right path .
nevertheless , I refer to problem in the economy , and there be , of course , problem in other area too .
Russia have clearly signal and plainly state that it energy price will rise by 10 % with effect from 1 January 2008 .
that will have a profound impact on the Ukrainian economy .
at the present time , Ukraine pay it debt to Russia with gas supply from it own underground deposit .
we shall see how that develop .
it will become a political issue again , and it be important for the European Union to intervene to keep the peace .
the Russians be entitle to raise their price , and it go without say that the Ukrainians will have to work out how to deal with the economic fallout .
take another point , namely social policy .
during the electoral campaign , all of the party that stand for election announce vast increase in welfare spending .
if you look at the present coalition agreement between the Tymoshenko alliance and the President & apos ; s bloc , you will see that there be no mention at all of an increase in welfare expenditure .
and indeed it would be virtually impossible , give the present level of government revenue , to effect the promised spending increase .
this mean that Ukrainian development be not advance a quickly a be always assert .
the next point to which I wish to refer be foreign policy .
during the election campaign , all party promise to move the country closer to the European Union .
the party that have always link this convergence with the European Union most closely with the issue of accession to NATO , namely the our Ukraine party , be the one that suffer the heaviest loss .
an absolute majority of the Ukrainian population be oppose to membership of NATO .
I therefore ask the European Union to proceed cautiously here .
the majority of the population do not want their country to join NATO .
all the available data indicate that they do want it to join the WTO .
if we consider , against this backdrop , how the partnership agreement should now be shape , the real need emerge in the area where Ukraine still have the difficulty I have list .
Ukraine must - and here I agree entirely with Mr Zaleski - have a European perspective , a prospect of accession to the EU .
it would be good for the European Union to have a strong partner in the East , and it would also be good for Ukraine in view of it general geostrategic orientation .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , our debate on the European Union & apos ; s trade and economic relation with Ukraine , the subject of Mr Zaleski & apos ; s very thorough report , come at a crucial time : parliamentary election have take place and the country & apos ; s economic and political problem need to be tackle vigorously by an energetic new government .
I be think of active measure against corruption .
with winter come , Ukraine also need a strong government which can negotiate with Russia on the supply and transit of Russian gas .
have read this report , I be inclined to say that Europe have make clear what it want .
the ball be now in Ukraine & apos ; s court .
the country must have not only an effective government , but also one which demonstrate a political determination to address the problem .
after five election in a many year , the population be understandably tire of all the political squabbling .
Ukraine & apos ; s politician must henceforth be concern le with each other and more with the country & apos ; s political and economic future .
yes , the ball be in Ukraine & apos ; s court , but I will say more than that , Mr President .
the European Union have work to do too .
I agree with what our rapporteur say in paragraph 51 , that the European neighbourhood Policy suffers from a lack of clear definition and perspective .
the prospect of EU membership must be extend to Ukraine in the medium or long term .
a part of the European neighbourhood Policy , the European Union can then initiate or support the reform need in the country .
( PL ) Mr President , Ukraine be a country with strategic importance within the European neighbourhood Policy , and it be an important partner for the country of the European Union .
we all hope that growth in trade between Ukraine and EU country will strengthen economic growth and cooperation with country in the region .
good economic relation be advantageous to both side .
economic growth in Ukraine should take place in parallel with respect for democracy and for the country & apos ; s law .
I be also think at this point of respect for the right of ethnic minority and , an issue that be important for me , activity that glorify fascism and genocide should not be permit .
we support democratic and economic process in our eastern neighbour .
on the other hand , it would seem appropriate to avoid biased and one-sided support for any political bloc in Ukraine .
( PL ) Mr President , act a you do earlier I would like first of all to congratulate Mr Zaleski on such an insightful report concern trade and economic relation with Ukraine .
the issue of cooperation with Ukraine be particularly important at present , and all the initiative aim at strengthen cooperation be a clear sign of European interest in our eastern neighbour and of openness on the part of the European Union .
the problem lie in the fact that the time when it would be appropriate to put into practice the idea of closer cooperation , go further than the European neighbourhood Policy , which have be of little benefit to Ukraine so far , be actually come .
it be undeniable that Ukraine still have far to go to approach the Community & apos ; s economic , political and social structure .
the task that Ukraine face have be thoroughly consider in the report .
despite the fact that Ukraine can boast of it achievement a regard liberalisation of trade and capital flow , further reform and strengthening of the Ukrainian economy , which include membership of the WTO , be essential .
despite the European aspiration air during the orange revolution , Ukraine still have to make an unequivocal choice between the European option and the Russian one .
if we want Ukraine to choose the European option , we must state this clearly and we must give this our support .
the EU should express it interest in contact with Ukraine by provide active support on the one hand for change in Ukraine and , on the other , by take step within the European Union aim at a gradual transition from a neighbourhood policy to a policy of integration .
for this purpose , step need to be take both on the economic front and in the social and political arena .
it would be appropriate , therefore , to support Ukraine & apos ; s independence from Russia by strengthen economic tie , which mean create an EU-Ukraine free trade area , include Ukraine in the Community & apos ; s power network , and possibly provide finance for the transport system .
it would also be useful to support and implement programme to promote Ukraine in the European Union a well a the European Union in Ukraine , and also programme to promote the development of science and education , which be an issue raise by Professor Buzek .
the most important step a regard change the image of the European Union in the eye of Ukrainians would be to abolish the visa requirement for travel to the European Union , a well a a clear statement , and this be something of which everyone have speak , that Ukraine will be able to accede to the European Union , even if this involve an extended time frame .
( LT ) On 18 October in Portugal President Yushchenko announce Ukraine & apos ; s intention to join the WTO this year .
Ukraine have already complete negotiation with the WTO country , with the exception of Kyrgyzstan , which still insist on recover the old debt of USD 27 million dating from Soviet time .
Ukraine & apos ; s acceptance into the WTO will result in a reduction in import tax and an increased number of importer .
however , it be important that Ukraine implement systematic economic reform .
despite positive change , such a the membership of the WTO , the public mood indicate the need for serious reform .
Ukraine be develop rapidly .
in recent year there have be significant growth in the GDP , but there be still a lot to be do in the area of economic productivity and competitiveness .
