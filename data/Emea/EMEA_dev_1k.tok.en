&quot; STATEMENT OF ACTIVE SUBSTANCE ( S )
&quot;
&quot; Maintenance phase :
&quot;
&quot; When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
&quot;
&quot; Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
&quot;
&quot; ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
&quot;
&quot; The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe ( Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l ) .
&quot;
&quot; In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .

&quot;
&quot; HOW TO TAKE ABILIFY
&quot;
&quot; The 2-3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of desired effects should be taken into account when assessing the efficacy of Abseamed .
&quot;
&quot; Starting dose of 50 IU / kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU / kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .

&quot; Injections of Abilify at doses of 10 or 15 mg were also more effective than placebo in reducing the symptoms of agitation , and were of similar effectiveness to lorazepam .

&quot; However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
&quot;
&quot; When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot;
&quot; Possible side effects 5 How to store ABILIFY 6 .
&quot;
&quot; Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l / kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
&quot;
&quot; It does not matter whether you take it with or without food .
&quot;
&quot; In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
&quot;
&quot; Magyarország BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB GYÓGYSZERKERESKEDELMI KFT .
&quot;
&quot; Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
&quot;
&quot; The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .

&quot; Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :

&quot;
&quot; All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .

&quot;
&quot; In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .

&quot; If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
