&quot; as an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .

&quot; potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :

&quot;
&quot; method AND route ( s ) OF administration
&quot;
&quot; in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
&quot;
&quot; read the package leaflet before use .
&quot;
&quot; in addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
&quot;
&quot; however , you should not dilute with other liquids or mix with other food prior to taking ABILIFY oral solution .
&quot;
&quot; if the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl ) .
&quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :

&quot; 4.2 Posology and method of administration
&quot;
&quot; when the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
