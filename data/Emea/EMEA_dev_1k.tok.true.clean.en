&quot; however , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
&quot;
&quot; although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .

&quot; if the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
&quot;
&quot; if the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .

&quot; the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .

&quot; 4.1 Therapeutic indications
&quot;
&quot; Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
&quot;
&quot; when aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
