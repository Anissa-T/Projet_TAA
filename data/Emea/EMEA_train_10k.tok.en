&quot; STATEMENT OF ACTIVE SUBSTANCE ( S )
&quot;
&quot; For any information about this medicine , please contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorisation Holder :
&quot;
&quot; If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
&quot;
&quot; In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
&quot;
&quot; Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
&quot;
&quot; For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
&quot;
&quot; Excipient :
&quot;
&quot; In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
&quot;
&quot; The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
&quot;
&quot; The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
&quot;
&quot; Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU / kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
&quot;
&quot; Abraxane has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines .

&quot; Immune system disorders :
&quot;
&quot; The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h , independent of dose , and unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
&quot;
&quot; Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
&quot;
&quot; Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
&quot;
&quot; Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .

&quot;
&quot; Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
&quot;
&quot; The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe ( Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l ) .
&quot;
&quot; Justification for not including braille accepted .
&quot;
&quot; In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .

&quot; General
&quot;
&quot; The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
&quot;
&quot; SPECIAL WARNING THAT THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT MUST BE STORED OUT OF THE REACH AND SIGHT OF CHILDREN
&quot;
&quot; Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .

&quot;
&quot; 109 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
&quot;
&quot; It has been proposed that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
&quot;
&quot; Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .

&quot;
&quot; If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells / µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU / kg 3 times a week or 450 IU / kg once weekly .
&quot;
&quot; Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
&quot;
&quot; Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
&quot;
&quot; The effect of the infusion lasts for a year or more .
&quot;
&quot; Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
&quot;
&quot; In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
&quot;
&quot; If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e . , the reticulocyte “ index ” ) is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microlitre or &lt; 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .

&quot;
&quot; As with all bisphosphonates , patients taking Aclasta may also be at risk of kidney problems , reactions at the site of infusion and osteonecrosis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
&quot;
&quot; Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 mmol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) .
&quot;
&quot; In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood ” : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .

&quot;
&quot; In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
&quot;
&quot; The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
&quot;
&quot; If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl ) .
&quot;

&quot; 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
&quot;
&quot; Abraxane should not be used in pregnancy , and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception , unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment with paclitaxel .
&quot;
&quot; The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot;
&quot; The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l ) .
&quot;
&quot; In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
&quot;
&quot; A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 mmol / l ) should be avoided .
&quot;
&quot; 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling
&quot;
&quot; Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .

&quot;
&quot; All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
&quot;
&quot; Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot;
&quot; Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 – 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 – 8.1 mmol / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
&quot;
&quot; No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
&quot;
&quot; 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling
&quot;
&quot; Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
&quot;
&quot; The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
&quot;
&quot; Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
&quot;
&quot; Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .

&quot; Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
&quot;
&quot; It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
&quot;
&quot; Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU / kg subcutaneously once weekly .

&quot; 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
&quot;
&quot; When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
&quot;
&quot; However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
&quot;
&quot; If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU / kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.62 mmol / l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells / µl the dose should remain at 300 IU / kg 3 times per week .
&quot;
&quot; Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
&quot;
&quot; 142 A .
&quot;
&quot; Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
&quot;
&quot; Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of &gt; 13 g / dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events cannot be excluded .

&quot; The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
&quot;
&quot; Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
&quot;
&quot; In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
&quot;
&quot; In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .

&quot; An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
&quot;
&quot; ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
&quot;
&quot; In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
&quot;
&quot; The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe ( Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l ) .

&quot;
&quot; Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
&quot;
&quot; Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .

&quot; The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
&quot;
&quot; In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .

&quot; When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
&quot;
&quot; However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .

&quot; STATEMENT OF ACTIVE SUBSTANCE ( S )
&quot;
&quot; Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
&quot;
&quot; Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
&quot;
&quot; ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
&quot;
&quot; 19 It has been proposed that aripiprazole ’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
&quot;
&quot; In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
&quot;
&quot; These measures will help to protect the environment .
&quot;
&quot; Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .

&quot; WHAT ABILIFY IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
&quot;
&quot; There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
&quot;
&quot; The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
&quot;
&quot; In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .

&quot;
&quot; Oral use
&quot;
&quot; Abilify
&quot;
&quot; In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
&quot;
&quot; In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
&quot;
&quot; Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
&quot;
&quot; A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptoms .

&quot;
&quot; It is especially important to mention the following to your doctor :
&quot;
&quot; Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
&quot;
&quot; Relative fracture
&quot;
&quot; At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
&quot;
&quot; - if the solution has been accidentally frozen .
&quot;
&quot; formation of a blood clot may occur .
&quot;
&quot; The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1 / 20th of the value ) .
&quot;
&quot; Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl :
&quot;
&quot; An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot;
&quot; In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
&quot;
&quot; Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .

&quot; SPECIAL STORAGE CONDITIONS
&quot;
&quot; The educational leaflet shall contain the following key elements : • That the use of epoetin alfa products can cause immunogenicity which in rare cases may lead to Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) • That with other epoetin products , the risk of immunogenicity in Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) is increased with the subcutaneous ( sc ) route . • There is insufficient data on Abseamed to know the size of any increased immunogenicity risk with subcutaneous use • Therefore , the sc route is not recommended for patients with CKD • The loss of efficacy or other symptoms of the development of immunogenicity should be investigated • Any suspected case of Pure Red Cell Aplasia or development of immunogenicity should be reported to the MAH
&quot;
&quot; Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .

&quot; BATCH NUMBER
&quot;
&quot; In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .

&quot; Abseamed is not recommended for injection under the skin in the treatment of kidney problems because further studies are needed to make sure that this does not cause allergic reactions .
&quot;
&quot; Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .

&quot;
&quot; Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
&quot;
&quot; There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
&quot;
&quot; Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY solution for injection in patients who are 65 years of age or older has not been established .
&quot;
&quot; Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot;
&quot; These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .

&quot; SPECIAL WARNING THAT THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT MUST BE STORED OUT OF THE REACH AND SIGHT OF CHILDREN
&quot;
&quot; Each tablet contains 10 mg of aripiprazole .
&quot;
&quot; Only take other medicines while you are on ABILIFY if your doctor tells you that you can .

&quot;
&quot; It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
&quot;
&quot; If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 mmol / l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g / dl ( 8.1 mmol / l ) m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g / dl - 12 g / dl ) .

&quot; STATEMENT OF ACTIVE SUBSTANCE
&quot;
&quot; OUTER CARTON
&quot;
&quot; In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU / kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
&quot;
&quot; 27 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
&quot;
&quot; In addition , cases of stroke or &quot; &quot; mini &quot; &quot; stroke have been reported .
&quot;
&quot; However , if the haemoglobin has increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
&quot;
&quot; In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .

&quot; As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
&quot;
&quot; If any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor or pharmacist .

&quot; It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
&quot;
&quot; It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .

&quot;
&quot; In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
&quot;
&quot; Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 – 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 – 8.1 mmol / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .

&quot;
&quot; Since zoledronic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have little or no capacity as a direct- acting and / or irreversible metabolism-dependent inhibitor of P450 enzymes , zoledronic acid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of substances which are metabolised via the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems .

&quot;
&quot; Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .
&quot;
&quot; In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture , it is recommended to give the Aclasta infusion two or more weeks after hip fracture repair ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot;
&quot; In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
&quot;
&quot; Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
&quot;
&quot; For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
&quot;
&quot; Because the active substance in Aclasta is the same as the active substance in Zometa , some of the data presented for Zometa were taken into account when assessing Aclasta .
&quot;
&quot; In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .

&quot;
&quot; Paclitaxel has been shown to be clastogenic in vitro ( chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes ) and in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) .
&quot;
&quot; A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
&quot;
&quot; CLINICAL PARTICULARS
&quot;
&quot; In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
&quot;
&quot; 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
&quot;
&quot; Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
&quot;
&quot; No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
&quot;
&quot; A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
&quot;
&quot; Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot;
&quot; Package size
&quot;
&quot; Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
&quot;
&quot; 88 Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .

&quot; OUTER CARTON
&quot;
&quot; A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with “ flu-like ” symptoms .
&quot;
&quot; SPECIAL STORAGE CONDITIONS
&quot;
&quot; ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
&quot;
&quot; Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .

&quot; 12 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
&quot;
&quot; Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot;
&quot; In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
&quot;
&quot; Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .

&quot;
&quot; 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
&quot;
&quot; Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
&quot;
&quot; The incidence of these symptoms decreased markedly with subsequent doses of Aclasta .
&quot;
&quot; QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
&quot;
&quot; Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
&quot;
&quot; Abilify was also more effective than placebo at preventing manic episodes returning in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks , and when it was used as an add-on to existing treatment .

&quot; WHAT ABILIFY IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
&quot;
&quot; In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .

&quot; 6.3 Shelf life
&quot;
&quot; Keep out of the reach and sight of children .
&quot;
&quot; Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
&quot;
&quot; If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
&quot;
&quot; Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
&quot;
&quot; Abraxane is used on its own .
&quot;
&quot; The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .

&quot;
&quot; A .
&quot;
&quot; As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
&quot;
&quot; OUTER CARTON
&quot;
&quot; In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .

&quot; PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS
&quot;
&quot; SPECIAL WARNING THAT THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT MUST BE STORED OUT OF THE REACH AND SIGHT OF CHILDREN
&quot;
&quot; Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 – 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 – 8.1 mmol / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
&quot;
&quot; In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
&quot;
&quot; Renal Disease :
&quot;
&quot; Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
&quot;
&quot; Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .

&quot; The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 times per week .
&quot;
&quot; In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
&quot;
&quot; 5.3 Preclinical safety data
&quot;
&quot; Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
&quot;
&quot; When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .

&quot; In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
&quot;
&quot; As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .

&quot; In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
&quot;
&quot; The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g / dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
&quot;
&quot; This medicine has been prescribed for you .
&quot;
&quot; Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
&quot;
&quot; In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
&quot;
&quot; At the start of your therapy , Abseamed may be injected by medical staff .
&quot;
&quot; Breast-feeding mothers should not take ABILIFY .
&quot;
&quot; Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .

&quot; This means that aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine to activate the receptors , but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters .
&quot;
&quot; The incidence of post-dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Aclasta administration ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot;
&quot; In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
&quot;
&quot; The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
&quot;
&quot; Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU / kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
&quot;

&quot; However , if the haemoglobin has increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
&quot;
&quot; Based on the published literature , in vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins , using paclitaxel at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 1.2 µM , indicate that about 87 % of paclitaxel is bound ; the presence of ranitidine , dexamethasone , or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel .

&quot; The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
&quot;
&quot; Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism .
&quot;
&quot; The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe ( Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
&quot;
&quot; In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .

&quot; It also decided that the benefits of the solution for injection outweighed its risks for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder , when oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot;
&quot; Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .

&quot;
&quot; 5.3 Preclinical safety data
&quot;
&quot; All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2 + daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
&quot;
&quot; Tablet disintegration occurs rapidly in saliva .
&quot;
&quot; In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .

&quot; 4.1 Therapeutic indications
&quot;
&quot; However , if the haemoglobin has increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .

&quot; Renal and urinary disorders :
&quot;
&quot; Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
&quot;
&quot; A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
&quot;
&quot; Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
&quot;
&quot; In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
&quot;
&quot; In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
&quot;
&quot; Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
&quot;
&quot; Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and

&quot; In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g / dl , the incidence of thrombotic / vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
&quot;
&quot; The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU / kg 3 times per week .
&quot;
&quot; Due to its α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
&quot;
&quot; In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
&quot;
&quot; In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
&quot;
&quot; This difference was not statistically significant .

&quot;
&quot; Class effects :
&quot;
&quot; In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
&quot;
&quot; ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot;
&quot; Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc . ) .

&quot;
&quot; Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12 .

&quot; Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
&quot;
&quot; However , if the haemoglobin has increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.62 mmol / l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .

&quot; 4.3 Contraindications
&quot;
&quot; HOW TO TAKE ABILIFY
&quot;
&quot; Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2 / D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .

&quot;
&quot; GENERAL CLASSIFICATION FOR SUPPLY
&quot;
&quot; The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
&quot;
&quot; The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
&quot;
&quot; The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
&quot;
&quot; The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe ( Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l ) .
&quot;
&quot; Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
