resumption of the session
I declare resume the session of the European Parliament adjourn on Friday 17 December 1999 , and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoy a pleasant festive period .
although , a you will have see , the dreaded & apos ; millennium bug & apos ; fail to materialise , still the people in a number of country suffer a series of natural disaster that truly be dreadful .
you have request a debate on this subject in the course of the next few day , during this part-session .
in the meantime , I should like to observe a minute & apos ; s silence , a a number of Members have request , on behalf of all the victim concern , particularly those of the terrible storm , in the various country of the European Union .
please rise , then , for this minute & apos ; s silence .
( the House rise and observe a minute & apos ; s silence )
Madam President , on a point of order .
you will be aware from the press and television that there have be a number of bomb explosion and killing in Sri Lanka .
one of the people assassinate very recently in Sri Lanka be Mr Kumar Ponnambalam , who have visit the European Parliament just a few month ago .
would it be appropriate for you , Madam President , to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President express Parliament & apos ; s regret at his and the other violent death in Sri Lanka and urge her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ?
yes , Mr Evans , I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggest would be entirely appropriate .
if the House agree , I shall do a Mr Evans have suggest .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concern inadmissibility .
my question relate to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again .
the Cunha report on multiannual guidance programme come before Parliament on Thursday and contain a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalty should be introduce for country which fail to meet their fleet reduction target annually .
it say that this should be do despite the principle of relative stability .
I believe that the principle of relative stability be a fundamental legal principle of the common fishery policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible .
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what be merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that be something I can competently do on Thursday .
that be precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i.e . on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .
Madam President , coincide with this year & apos ; s first part-session of the European Parliament , a date have be set , unfortunately for next Thursday , in Texas in America , for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who have be sentence to death.We shall call him Mr Hicks .
at the request of a French Member , Mr Zimeray , a petition have already be present , which many people sign , include myself .
however , I would ask you , in accordance with the line which be now constantly follow by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community , to make representation , use the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent , to the President and to the Governor of Texas , Mr Bush , who have the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person .
this be all in accordance with the principle that we have always uphold .
thank you , Mr Segni , I shall do so gladly .
indeed , it be quite in keep with the position this House have always adopt .
Madam President , I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament have consistently show an interest .
it be the case of Alexander Nikitin .
all of u here be pleased that the court have acquit him and make it clear that in Russia , too , access to environmental information be a constitutional right .
now , however , he be to go before the court once more because the public prosecutor be appeal .
we know , and we have state a much in very many resolution indeed , include specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year , that this be not solely a legal case and that it be wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accuse of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement a the beneficiary of his finding .
these finding form the basis of the European programme to protect the Barents Sea , and that be why I would ask you to examine a draft letter set out the most important fact and to make Parliament & apos ; s position , a express in the resolution which it have adopt , clear a far a Russia be concern .
yes , Mrs Schroedter , I shall be please to look into the fact of this case when I have receive your letter .
Madam President , I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have keep your word and that , during this first part-session of the new year , the number of television channel in our office have indeed increase considerably .
but , Madam President , my personal request have not be meet .
although there be now two Finnish channel and one Portuguese one , there be still no Dutch channel , which be what I have request because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we be send to this place of exile every month .
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel a well .
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , I can tell you that this matter be on the agenda for the Quaestors & apos ; meeting on Wednesday .
it will , I hope , be examine in a positive light .
Madam President , can you tell me why this Parliament do not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually pass ?
why have no air quality test be do on this particular building since we be elect ?
why have there be no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998 ?
why have there be no fire drill , either in the Brussels Parliament building or the Strasbourg Parliament building ?
why be there no fire instruction ?
why have the staircase not be improve since my accident ?
why be no-smoking area not enforce ?
it seem absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .
Mrs Lynne , you be quite right and I shall check whether this have actually not be do .
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors , and I be certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulation we ourselves vote on .
Madam President , Mrs Díez González and I have table question on certain opinion of the Vice-President , Mrs de Palacio , which appear in a Spanish newspaper .
the competent service have not include them in the agenda on the ground that they have be answer in a previous part-session .
I would ask that they reconsider , since this be not the case .
the question answer previously refer to Mrs de Palacio & apos ; s intervention , on another occasion , and not to these comment which appear in the ABC newspaper on 18 November .
Mr Berenguer Fuster , we shall check all this .
I admit that , at present , the matter seem to be somewhat confused .
we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything be a it should be .
Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message go out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today & apos ; s decision refusing to renew the arm embargo on Indonesia , consider that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorse the arm embargo in Indonesia in the past ?
today & apos ; s decision not to renew the embargo be extremely dangerous consider the situation there .
so Parliament should send a message , since that be the wish of the vast majority .
it be irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo .
a people have say , the situation there be extremely volatile .
there be , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future .
we do not know what be happen .
so why should EU arm producer profit at the expense of innocent people ?
in any event , this question be not presently include among the request for topical and urgent debate on Thursday .
agenda
the next item be the verification of the final version of the draft agenda a draw up by the Conference of Presidents at it meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure .
no amendment have be propose relate to Monday and Tuesday .
relate to Wednesday :
the Group of the Party of European Socialists request that a Commission statement be include on it strategic objective for the next five year and on the administrative reform of the Commission .
I would like Mr Barón Crespo , who make the request , to speak to propose it.That be , if he so wish , of course .
then we shall follow the usual procedure , hear one speaker in favour and one against .
Madam President , the presentation of the Prodi Commission & apos ; s political programme for the whole legislature be initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which be unanimously approve by the Conference of Presidents in September and which be also explicitly accept by President Prodi , who reiterate his commitment in his inaugural speech .
this commitment be important because the Commission be a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and , therefore , basically dictate this Parliament & apos ; s political and legislative activity for the next five year .
I would also like to point out , Madam President , that this Parliament vote to express it confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature.It do so again during this legislature , in July , and then , in September , it vote once more to approve the whole Commission .
there have therefore be enough time for the Commission to prepare it programme and for u to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizen .
to this end , I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September , which recommend that the proposal be present a soon a possible .
the event of last week - which originate outside the Conference of Presidents , that Conference be use simply to corroborate and ratify decision take elsewhere - present u with a dilemma.Either the Commission be not ready to present this programme , in which case it should clarify it .
accord to it President , it be in a position to do so .
give that the Commission be represent by Vice-President de Palacio , I believe that , before voting , it would help if the Commission could let u know how ready it be to present this programme , a agreed.Alternatively , Parliament be not ready to examine this programme , a some appear to be suggest .
my Group believe that since a parliament be mean to listen , debate and reflect , there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that , if the Commission be ready to do so , we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfil our duty to our fellow citizen .
therefore , Madam President , I would ask you to request that the Commission express it opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote .
( applause from the PSE Group )
Madam President , I would like to make it very clear that , above all , the Commission have absolute respect for the decision of this Parliament and , amongst those , the decision establish it agenda .
we therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide .
but I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi make a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate , a Mr Barón Crespo have remind u , which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission & apos ; s legislative programme , on the broad area of action for the next five year , that be to say , for this legislature .
Madam President , I would like to say that the agreement reach in September distinguish this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission & apos ; s legislative programme .
I would also like to say that the Commission be prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it be convenient and that we be ready to do so this week a we have agree originally , on the basis that it would be present the day before in a speech to parliamentary group .
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on it strategic objective should be reinstate .
( Parliament reject the request ) President .
still on the subject of Wednesday & apos ; s sit , I have another proposal regard the oral question on capital tax .
the PPE-DE Group be request that this item be take off the agenda .
be there a member who wish to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this ?
Madam President , I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists.I be tell that large section of the Socialist Group be also keen to have this item take off the agenda , because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote be receive from the work group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter .
I do not know whether this information be correct , but the PPE-DE Group would , in any case , be grateful if this item be remove because Parliament have address this issue several time already .
decision have also be adopt against a tax of this kind .
that be why my Group move that this item be take off the agenda .
thank you , Mr Poettering .
we shall now hear Mr Wurtz speak against this request .
Madam President , I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering & apos ; s lack of logic .
he have just be preach to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they go back on a decision take in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents , and now he be do just the same .
we discuss that matter and we be unanimous , with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups.As my fellow chairman will recall , I even mention that it be not a matter of know whether one be for or against the Tobin tax , but of whether one dare to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it .
it be not a lot to ask .
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retain so that we can find out , once and for all , the position of these two body regard the proposal which be relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion , particularly after the tide of feel generate by the failure of the Seattle Conference .
we shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group & apos ; s request that the oral question regard the capital tax be withdraw from the agenda .
( Parliament reject the request , with 164 vote for , 166 vote against and 7 abstention )
Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate .
thank you very much .
Madam President , have my vote be count ? I be unable to vote electronically , since I do not have a card .
my vote be & quot ; in favour & quot ; .
indeed , if we add the two Members who have declare themselves , then the result of the vote would be ....
Madam President , the Presidency have already declare the result of the vote .
there be no room for amendment .
Madam President , in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicate that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group .
that do not happen .
I would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , I might be allow to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group .
this be an important matter .
it would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just do in the light of their own political analysis .
Madam President , I do not wish to reopen the debate , but I have also ask for the floor , to comment on Mr Barón Crespo & apos ; s motion .
you do not call me either .
I regret this , but the vote have already be take and the decision be make so let u leave the matter there .
I be terribly sorry , Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox.I do not see you ask to speak .
even so , I think the position be quite clear and they shall be enter in the Minutes .
when we adopt the Minutes for today & apos ; s sit tomorrow , then any Members who think the position have not be explain clearly enough may ask for amendment .
this seem to me to be a workable solution .
of course , the Minutes for tomorrow & apos ; s sit will take into account any additional explanation .
I think this be a better solution than proceed now to extremely time-consuming explanation of vote .
Mr Cox , Mr Hänsch , would this be acceptable to you ?
Madam President , if the vote record correctly how my Group vote I shall not , and can not , object to that .
if your ruling be that I can not give an explanation of vote , I accept that but with reservation .
we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes , a we always do , of course .
if they do not properly reflect the position adopt , then we may correct them , if necessary .
( the order of business be adopt thus amend )
safety adviser for the transport of dangerous good
Commissioner , Madam President , lady and gentleman , I can be quite frank in say that I welcome the Council & apos ; s common position on harmonise the training of safety adviser for the transport of dangerous good by road , rail or inland waterway .
firstly , we need to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirement of Directive 96 / 35 / EC , which oblige the Member States to appoint safety adviser and to organise the training , instruction and examination of these people but do not explain this explicitly .
secondly , by adopt this directive we achieve a ) an increase in safety when dangerous good be both transported and transhipped ; b ) a reduction in distortion of competition result from wide variation in national training structure and training cost and c ) equal opportunity for safety adviser on the European labour market .
thirdly , this directive , a it currently stand in the common position , guarantee - in particular because it confine itself exclusively to minimum standard - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union ; by adopt it we contribute to the Member States & apos ; bear a high level of individual responsibility .
all of this be in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and be therefore to be greatly welcome .
our amendment from the first reading have , I believe , be take into account very satisfactorily .
they have either be accept or transpose with no change in the substance , or they have be reject because the corresponding European arrangement have not be include , for example a system of penalty for violation of the rule or a complex classification structure for related group of question .
the one unanimously adopt amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport , which concern the timetable for implement the directive , be something which I would urge you to support .
by not set a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead give them a period of three month after it entry into force , we be introduce a flexibility clause which ensure that the directive will be implement without delay .
I would urge you to endorse this .
a an Austrian , I still have a vivid memory , a , I believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human life last year in the Tauern Tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the part of the tunnel which have be destroy in this fire continue for many month at huge expense .
the renovation project , which last for month , cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe .
the traffic which have to be divert because of this stretch the patience of many thousand of people in the EU to the limit .
in fact , all hell break loose in some municipality in my province .
prevention have to be our answer to disaster of this kind and this draft directive be an important step towards well-trained safety adviser be available , so that the right action be take in good time .
all the same , we must not content ourselves with enact European law to ensure greater safety .
we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rule be transpose by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they be also apply afterwards .
please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement .
I should like to address one final point.We must not content ourselves with seal another hole in the safety net and shut our eye to the fact that , where transport safety in Europe be concern , there be still much more to be do .
in this context , I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible , who be with u here today , to table an appropriate text a soon a possible with a view to continue to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnel in the future , so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disaster on this scale .
Madam President , first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which have , at it heart , the issue of transport safety .
the report look at the issue of harmonise the examination requirement for safety advisor work in the area of transportation of dangerous good by road , rail and inland waterway .
I congratulate him on his excellent report .
the rapporteur have point out to the House that in it common position the Council have accept six of Parliament & apos ; s ten amendment put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament & apos ; s other amendment have be retain .
my Group will therefore support the common position and look forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide u with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union a safe a possible .
when it come to safety my Group will always support any initiative to improve transport safety .
we still have a lot of work to do in this area a recent event have prove .
Madam President , I would like to make a few comment .
I would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the Commission for the proposal it have submit .
we be concern here with the harmonisation of examination requirement but also , in fact , with minimum requirement .
this be a pity , in a sense .
needle to say , safety on road , railway and inland waterway be of key importance and , give the international nature of these type of transport , train for safety advisor should also be harmonise , therefore , a well a the requirement of the new ADR , for example , which be under way .
this be important , but so be enforcement and there be , of course , a number of reason why we need to pay particular attention to this .
just think of the road accident which have occur over recent year , for example in Belgium , the Netherlands and a number of other country where lorry carry dangerous good continue to drive in foggy condition when really they should have pull off the road instead .
or ship from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ship over here , with all the obvious risk that this entail .
furthermore , it have transpire that research in the port in Belgium , Finland , but also in Japan have show that 50 % of container with partially dangerous cargo be not deliver correctly for shipment .
in short , the issue be an important one .
if we look at the situation where safety adviser be concern , in a number of country it be compulsory to employ such safety adviser in company a from 1 January of this year .
there will be major problem with enforce this rule at present , especially with smaller company , a these can not afford safety advisor .
these smaller company either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which cause problem .
it be therefore also be request that ISO 9002 certificate possibly include the finer detail of these activity in the form of annual report and company analysis .
the work be done.All that remain be the business of enforcement .
I would like to mention one final point .
with regard to enforcement , proper agreement must also be conclude with the Eastern European country because they will not enter into treaty which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001 , that be to say in eighteen month & apos ; time .
this give them a competitive edge for the interim period .
this be not in itself anything dreadful , but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspect for good transport by road , rail and inland waterway and incorporate these , a part of the acquis communautaire , a soon a possible and present them to the accede state .
Madam President , the importance of transport safety be highlight on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so .
the ever increase volume of good pass through Europe entail all kind of risk , know and unknown , for employee and the social environment .
those have to deal with these risk should therefore meet stringent requirement .
the relevant standard which have be lay down in another Directive , 95 / 35 / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous good .
I be very pleased that agreement have also be reach with the Council on minimum standard regard examination , although I would have prefer it if uniform , set standard and module have be establish , so that certificate would be of equal value internationally .
this , however , do not seem feasible .
finally , the amendment table by the rapporteur be perfectly logical and I can , therefore , give it my wholehearted support .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his report which , though technical , be nonetheless of very great significance for safety .
I should like to make just a few comment .
firstly , I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I be convince that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention be pay to the issue of safety , be it on the road , on the waterway or at sea .
consider that it be only today that we be deal with a Commission proposal first make on 19 March 1998 , even though Parliament respond relatively quickly , this time lag be a little too long .
this be not just the fault of the Commission , but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so a to achieve harmonisation in this area a well .
my second point have already be mention : it concern the minimum standard .
in principle , I believe that in many case where transport be concern we should be work towards increase flexibility and country-specific rule .
however , when it come to safety , I be rather sceptical because safety in Sweden , for example , be in principle no different from safety in Germany , Italy or Austria .
I can live with these minimum standard , but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully .
should flexibility of this kind result in there be inadequate rule in some country then we should work towards greater harmonisation .
my third point have also be mention already .
a you know , like Mr Rack , I come from a transit country , where this issue play a particularly important role .
we do not want to make the condition of competition worse for some country unilaterally and improve them for country such a Austria or other transit country .
but I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous good to a minimum , in all country , whether they be transit country or not .
we understand that it be important that the two institution - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy , and in particular the transport group , be magnificent .
the common position include practically all of the amendment accept by the Commission and harmonise the minimum examination requirement for safety adviser and , at second reading , we can accept the amendment on the propose date , which be much more realistic than the one originally suggest by the Commission , bearing in mind that we have now spend several year debate this question .
very briefly , I would like to thank the various Members for their intervention and to tell you that safety be one of the Commission & apos ; s priority in the field of transport .
a Mr Simpson have say very correctly , this be a process which we can never take for grant or regard a have come to an end .
the process of increase safety margin and safety guarantee in transport be a process which must be improve day by day .
in this regard , I would also like to refer very briefly to the problem of the tunnel , which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have refer to , which , in the case of Austria , be doubtless a very sensitive issue , and great effort should be make to improve their safety .
in one of the worst accident to have occur recently , the good be transport be not dangerous in themselves .
Margarine and a few kilo of paint which , in principle , do not present risk , lead to a genuine disaster .
therefore , we will have to see how the requirement guarantee the maximum degree of safety can be further improve .
finally , I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all type of transport .
this week we will be hold a debate here on the safety of sea transport , in light of the Erika disaster , and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objective in term of the safety of air transport .
but I would like to say that safety be a priority objective for the Commission .
a I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster , we do not wait until there be a disaster to deal with the question of safety , but we work on it even when there be no such circumstance , which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem .
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speaker and especially to the rapporteur , Mr Koch .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
transport of dangerous good by road
delay in the CEN & apos ; s work be now make it difficult to apply this very directive .
in particular , annex can not be adapt to take account of technical and industrial development .
I regret this since we be have to take action because others have not do their job .
in this respect , I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94 / 55 / EC which have be table for discussion today .
should the European Union fail to take action , then Member States would be oblige to amend their national legislation for a very brief period , until the CEN complete it work , which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty .
the amendment to the directive on today & apos ; s agenda do not therefore affect the exist harmonisation of the transport of dangerous good in the Community .
it merely prolong transitional rule by postpone deadline , deletes provision which be no longer applicable , and lay down the procedure for a ) carry out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous good and b ) enact le stringent national regulation , in particular for the transport of very small amount of dangerous good within strictly define local area .
the amendment to the directive be consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the Member States obtain more power .
the Commission decide whether the Member States may impose certain rule of their own.In so do , it be support by a committee of expert on the transport of dangerous good under the regulatory procedure .
the procedure for the exercise of these implement power confer on the Commission be lay down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999 .
the proposal to be discuss today , to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous good by road , date from May 1999 , however , and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure .
two of the amendment table and adopt unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amend comitology procedure .
we would like to ensure that there be a reference to this a early a the recital and that the period within which the Council have to make a decision - which be not clearly word - be set at a maximum of three month .
in addition , the need for greater transparency have be point out .
a further amendment allow the Member States to impose more stringent requirement , in particular for vacuum tank , if work be do or good be transport a a priority in temperature well below -20ºC.This be in the special interest of northern European region .
a final amendment be intend to ensure that tank and tanker put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be use provide that they have be construct and maintain in accordance with it .
I do realise that this be only a small step towards increase transport safety , but I would ask you to endorse this report .
Mr President , colleague , a happy new year and millennium to you all .
I be speak for the first time in this plenary part-session , so this be quite exciting for me , a little like first love , although that do last longer than two minute .
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission & apos ; s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous good by road .
it be good that this directive should be establish now , a , otherwise , Member States would have to amend their national act for a very short time , a period of transition , which would again mean unnecessary cost and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy .
the Commission & apos ; s proposal , however , do not take account of all the fact , such a the cold climate that prevail in the northern region .
consequently , I have table some amendment to Mr Koch & apos ; s intrinsically excellent report , which have be adopt by our committee .
my amendment concern the frost-resistance rating for tanker carry these dangerous good .
accord to the Commission & apos ; s proposal -20ºC would have be sufficient.On the shore of the Mediterranean , it be hard to imagine that in Lapland temperature can fall considerably lower than that .
there be support for the EU in Lapland also , so let u remember them .
I have thus propose that the frost rating be lower to -40ºC .
this would be necessary to keep safety standard at the level they be in northern region previously .
I hope my proposal will be take into consideration in tomorrow & apos ; s vote .
Mr President , with your permission I should like to begin by express my admiration for the way in which you execute the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate .
I think that it be quite superb .
on the subject at hand , I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the good - however dangerous they be - which be transport on Europe & apos ; s road , railway , and so on be a safe a possible .
this directive be a contribution to this .
what we be do today be essentially a nuisance .
the rapporteur , Mr Koch , to whom we express our thanks for the work which he have do on this , have already point out that basically everything could have be somewhat more advanced have it not be for the inactivity on the part of the CEN , which have be very dilatory in draw up and adapt the directive .
that be why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that , in 2001 , we will finally have Community regulation for the transport of dangerous good by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our road be a good deal safer .
Mr President , the report we be discuss here do not , in itself , entail any major change .
most of the propose amendment be of a purely technical nature .
it be nonetheless worth emphasise that , each time we make this type of decision , it be good from a broad environmental perspective and it be beneficial because it create better prior condition for exploit the possibility of the internal market .
very large quantity of dangerous good be transport around the EU , both on road and railway and by sea .
this make it necessary to have proper rule govern transport of this kind .
in area after area , we be now obtain common minimum regulation for the Member States .
this be extraordinarily positive , and there be cause to thank the rapporteur , Mr Koch , for the work he have put in on this issue .
this be also important where the prerequisite for the internal market be concern .
if we be to get a common transport market genuinely up and run , it be important that we should not only have regulation but that these regulation should also , a far a possible , apply to every country .
I should like to conclude by comment on a third matter which be also of significance , namely an amendment table by Member of Parliament , Mr Ari Vatanen .
in many way , the prerequisite differ from one Member State to another .
by approve this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern part of the European Union .
this make it necessary to also take account of the way in which material and packaging be affect by cold of this kind .
it be good that , in establish the present regulation , we can also be flexible .
I hope that the Commission be able to accept the present amendment .
Mr President , I would like to thank not only Mr Koch , but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declare their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledge it a a priority .
the reason Mr Koch produce his sound report be because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission be proceed none too expeditiously .
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she be in a position to tell u today what the state of play be with regard to the effort towards harmonisation be make by these two organisation , and whether the EU be in a position to hasten these harmonisation effort , in accordance with principle that be a simple a possible .
for one thing be clear : even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union , traffic do not stop at our border , it go beyond them .
hence there be certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provision .
if the Commissioner be unable to do so today then would she be prepare to inform the committee in writing of how matter stand and what stage negotiation between the CEN and the Economic Commission be at ?
Mr President , I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way supplement the debate which we hold in October on rail transport .
we all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation ( CEN ) have not be able , in the required time , to carry out the amendment of the provision necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union .
this debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow u to incorporate differentiating element which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours .
a moment ago , Mr Vatanen speak to u of lower temperature , not of 20 degree below zero , but of 40 degree below zero .
of course , we accept that amendment - it be absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstance which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union , which sometimes take the form of specific and of concrete requirement for the establishment of standard and characterisation of a technical nature .
I would like to say , with regard to Mr Swoboda & apos ; s comment on the activity of the CEN , that we be urge them to speed up their work a much a possible because it would be terrible if , despite the new deadline , we be to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulty because their work have not be conclude .
lastly , Mr President , the basic problem justify this amendment of the directive have be point out.We have refer to the delay by the CEN , the amendment of certain provision , the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annex and the need to for it to be more specific .
the Commission accept all of the contribution of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , Mr Koch , which be contain in the various amendment , specifically four .
we therefore accept the four amendment which have be propose .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination
the next item be the report ( A5-0108 / 1999 ) by Mrs Schroedter , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund : guideline for programme in the period 2000-2006 & # 91 ; COM ( 1999 ) 344 - C5-0122 / 1999 - 1999 / 2127 ( COS ) & # 93 ; .
Mr President , it be particularly please for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what be regard a the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament , namely Wales .
a major part of Wales , a you know , have be grant Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme .
it be quite clear that many people within Wales be look to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulty that we undoubtedly face .
we have see poverty grow in Wales ; and grow still further since 1997 .
we have see the gap between rich and poor widen .
we be look , therefore , within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality .
what be , however , deeply damage for u be the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance be something that have be , in a sense , a success of the government.It be sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulty that Wales face .
that be why I want to highlight some of the issue that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront .
we look to the Commission to deal with point in relation to additionality .
we be dissatisfy with the fact that those figure seem to have be in some way hide within UK figure .
we look to the Commission also to ensure that there be matched funding for project .
we look to it to challenge the UK Government , to ensure that the private sector , which surely must be provide the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure , be involve in the planning stage .
finally , we ask that the Commission ensure that Structural Fund monies be spend in a way which be transparent .
too much of what take place within this Parliament be not transparent .
this be one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales .
Mr President , our committee view these issue very differently and , to start , I will speak from the point of view of research .
we see it a a very positive sign that , in her own conclusion , the rapporteur have take account of our committee & apos ; s proposal that the Cohesion Fund country should broaden the research infrastructure by locate university and college in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped region better than now and make it easier for educate people to remain in their home district .
this will be possible with action on the part of government , and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in even out development .
another matter we would like to address , specifically from the point of view of industrial policy , be that we would have like the Commission to pay more attention to the effect of service , electronic commerce and the grow use of the Internet , when they be plan the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds .
poverty and wealth use to depend more on mean of livelihood .
the rich area be those where there be job in industry , but today those area might have become a burden , and they may well be poor , mean we also have to invest in new sector of industry such a electronic production , a I might call it , and the production of service , because they be the industry of the future .
in my opinion the committee draft the report have not take sufficient account of this , so on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I would draw the Commission & apos ; s attention to this issue .
Mr President , I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she have do on this and to explain to colleague that I be speak for my colleague , Mrs Flautre , who follow this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who be unfortunately ill .
I would like to draw people & apos ; s attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which be agree by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accept by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
these amendment deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local scheme to develop employment opportunity and strengthen social cohesion .
in the past , this Parliament have view the social economy a an important potential provider of employment .
these amendment also fit in with this Parliament & apos ; s view that social exclusion be a serious issue need constructive action .
we hope that those consider rejection of these amendment have very powerful reason to offer to both Parliament and their citizen who be seek employment .
in her report , Mrs Flautre also draw attention to an area where coordination be sorely lacking , yet desperately need .
the Commission proposal refer to the four pillar of employment strategy and the five field of action of the European Social Fund .
but the lack of specific guideline here be particularly to be regret , a the idea of link Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme .
it could be say that the omission give the impression that the Commission too have no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance , which be subject to review after three and a half year , and the Member States & apos ; annual national plan for employment .
we hope that the Commission can reassure u that this be an oversight which be now be deal with constructively .
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal present by the Commission , in accordance with it mandate , be a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
I would like to point out , however , that this start point indicate to u the challenge which face u : maintain a population in rural area , give the change take place in all type of economic activity owe to agriculture & apos ; s increase lack of importance amongst the various source of income for rural society .
this , a well a the deficiency in the network of infrastructure and service and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore be seasonal and lack diversity , exacerbate the exodus from rural area .
the consequence do not inspire hope .
it be the young people who be disappear , who be get an education and find work outside of the rural area , all of which have an unfavourable effect on those area .
this lack of infrastructure be also an obstacle to the establishment of company and the creation of job .
we have to remember that rural area represent almost four fifth of the territory of the European Union .
agriculture only provide 5.5 % of employment in the Union .
furthermore , three quarter of our farm worker be part-time and require supplement to their income .
therefore , we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which be consistent with the objective we have set.We want rural area , at the dawn of the 21st century , to be competitive and multi-functional , both with regard to agriculture and with regard to open up to the diversity of non-agricultural activity .
it be important to prioritise general criterion for land planning and demographic equilibrium , and to bear in mind the conclusion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issue , which have be only partly take up by the Committee on Transport , Regional Policy and Tourism in it point 16 and 17 .
in conclusion , I would ask the Commission to take these five point into account when establish the conclusion on the four pillar because I believe that , for the European Union , maintain the population in rural area must be one of the priority objective .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thank Mrs Schroedter , the rapporteur , for her work .
I think that this work have be carry out extremely well .
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political group when compromise formula have need to be reach in the face of this avalanche of amendment - and perhaps there be more of them than we expect - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we be now discuss .
we feel that it be important that the Commission take account of the conclusion adopt by this Parliament , at least in spirit , because at this stage , it might seem a though what we be do here be a useless exercise , and nothing but hot air .
the truth of the matter though be that we believe - and this be also show in the way the conclusion have be draft - that the Commission must take account of what be adopt by this Parliament , particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directive .
in order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attain these objective , we think that those who generate employment , the real entrepreneur and those who really guarantee new source of employment , that be , businesspeople , must participate in this initiative .
small and medium-sized business , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these fund .
if they do not , if businesspeople feel marginalise , if entrepreneur can not take part , not only in manage but also in receive these fund , we will have miss an opportunity to attain our objective more rapidly .
also , in order to attain our objective , to overcome the disparity between region and to seek out source of employment , it be crucial to give our complete support to new technology , to transport and communication network and to renewable energy .
all of this must be do - I repeat - with the participation of private business , which , by unite it effort with those of public administration , but complement them , never obstruct or exclude them , will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of job .
Mr President , it be incumbent upon me to remind my colleague , Mr Evans , of why Wales actually achieve Objective 1 status .
it be because of the discredited policy of his own Conservative Party .
let me also remind him that when his party leader , Mr Hague , be Secretary of State for Wales , he break every rule in the book on additionality which lead to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regard regulatory requirement .
I can tell you that the British Government be aware of it regulatory requirement on Objective 1 additionality .
I suggest Mr Evans go back and read the regulation .
my Group have make extensive amendment to both report up for debate today .
I want to focus our mind on the essential role of the guideline .
the objective be to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration , to get the most effective use of resource in the widest partnership and to put these region back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine .
it be important to identify the skill and potential of our region in the hi-tech sector .
it be particularly important in the light of report in the medium that Europe be rapidly lose ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industry of the future .
the operation of the previous round of programme be also very instructive in tell u what guideline should not be about .
they should not be about create additional layer of bureaucracy and red tape .
they should not be about shift priority and policy halfway through project development , result in inevitable delay and underspends , particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement .
the implementation and operation of the guideline can not be leave to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the Commission or in the civil service .
there must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate , while respect the specific local and regional aspect of Commission programme .
the conclusion be that we must make the case for guideline to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme manager and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new field of regeneration .
if we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak region we will eventually get them back onto the road of attract substantial investor confidence , which will be the key to future success .
this be how we be go to judge the success of these guideline : whether EU regional policy with a good , solid , enable guideline , can open up new opportunity and allow our poor and structurally weak region to play their full part in contribute to the growth and prosperity of the EU .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report.She have go into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she take account of many of the amendment that have be table regard this report .
the rapporteur have also quite rightly state that Parliament be not hear in time regard the guideline .
we be badly behind now in this matter .
hopefully , the stand Parliament have take will help , however , in the mid-term appraisal of the programme and in their practical implementation .
for the time , the report grow too large when it be be debate .
it contain detail and issue that have already be raise in previous report .
at this stage it be more important to concentrate on assess how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy , bear in mind that the aim be to reduce regional inequality .
our Group emphasise the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of Member States and the role of local player in draft and implement programme .
it be especially important to get SMEs involve in the planning and implementation of programme .
our Group also consider it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral area and wish to increase interaction between town and rural area .
we oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and it Member States exercise and we be call for a reduction in the bureaucracy that have take root in the drafting and implementation of programme .
project implement with support from the Union have have their effect water down all too often by slow decision making and complicate administrative process .
fund have often be grant for project which have have no lasting benefit for the area concern .
project have to be carry out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be make more productive .
while the report be be prepare , it be interest to discuss the Union & apos ; s regional policy in general .
for u new member , it be the first time , and this be a very interesting process .
this report be very good and our Group support it .
Mr President , Commissioner , a proof that this Parliament have not yet overcome it role a a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , Elisabeth Schroedter , have not be able to reach plenary sitting because the plan for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 region have be sit in the Commission & apos ; s office for several month .
bear this in mind , this House should , in any event , demand that , before the Community support framework for the period in question be approve , they be study and submit for debate in this Parliament , specifically in light of the guideline that we have present today .
this be because we think that they be particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed region and we would thus contribute to reverse the harmful trend towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe .
Mr President , we should not forget that the main , strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination be to achieve economic and social cohesion .
we be oblige to participate in draft directive and also in assess their result .
we be oblige to do so because we be the representative of the citizen in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions .
we feel that the Funds be a necessary but insufficient condition for achieve economic and social cohesion .
we might be mistake in use the gross domestic product per inhabitant a the sole indicator .
some speaker have already mention unemployment and the fall in population .
we will have to study several indicator , which will enable u to see the current state of regional society that be in a worse situation than others , and how they be evolve .
it be clear from some of the report that have be present to Parliament & apos ; s plenary sit today that Europe & apos ; s 25 most prosperous region enjoy a level of unemployment which be five time lower than in the 25 least prosperous region .
this fact mean that the European Parliament , the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically .
I agree that the European Parliament do not have the opportunity - or that it be not give the opportunity , a we have reach the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directive .
I do not think , however , that this report have come too late .
we need to consider it together , so that the new Objective 1 programme and the plan for regional development , which have be draft before the directive come into force , can be submit for revision and proper assessment .
we all agree that we should ask that , halfway through these programme , when the assessment of the directive be make , Parliament should be give an equally influential role on the ground that we be the citizen & apos ; representative .
our citizen can not accept that the European Union take decision in a way that be , at least on the face of it , bureaucratic .
they need to see the political dimension work , to see that official accept their responsibility and that there be communication with the citizen .
this be what we be today ask the Commissioner for .
I would like to think that , give his previous experience a a regional President , he will agree to propose indicator , and a strategy , which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity .
Mr President , I support the main proposal of the report concern the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendation of the report which include the following : there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds .
this mean that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authority and national government with regard to how these fund be to be spend .
Member States be urge to attach greater importance to integrate strategy for revitalise relation between town and rural area .
this latter point be of particular importance .
while urban renewal in our city be very important we must always strike a balance in our policy between promote rural development and improve the life of city dweller .
we do not want to build a Europe of city alone .
the Structural Funds have play a key role in the development both of urban and rural part of peripheral country , mainly through the upgrading of road , water treatment and related transport network .
this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guideline lay down by the EU leader at their Berlin Summit last year , which be support by Parliament at it last May plenary part-session .
key EU programme between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly help to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral country and Objective 1 region within Europe .
the key now be to consolidate and make permanent the progress make to date.This would ensure that the peripheral country and the ultraperipheral region , the poorer region in Europe , be in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone , a well a within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of good , person , service and capital exist .
in conclusion , while key infrastructure project have be support by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund , we should remember that the European Social Fund have play a very important role in help the le well-off in our society .
the Social Fund have certainly improve our third-level institution , finance our post-leaving certificate programme and put in place comprehensive scheme to help combat youth and long-term unemployment , assist early school leaver and promote higher standard of adult literacy .
Mr President , on numerous occasion in the past I have disagree with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues.This time , however , I actually agree with her .
whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path , I can not say.Nevertheless , I would like to commend her on her work .
the second point I would like to make be that we would have prefer it if the guideline have be add to the regulation in the form of an annex , a we and Mrs McCarthy , a rapporteur for the general regulation , have ask .
unfortunately , this do not happen.Mr Bernié be not to blame for this a it be a matter for the previous committee .
I be raise the issue just to reiterate Parliament & apos ; s position .
thirdly , we broadly agree on the general guideline provide they do not deviate from the comment we have make so far .
they be particularly beneficial to the Member States , and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission have place on the issue of sustainable development , job creation and , more particularly , on equal opportunity and transport issue .
personally , I at least be totally in favour of the guideline .
a an islander , however , I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development .
this be not the first time that this issue have not be give the consideration it deserves.This have be an ongoing concern for the five year that I have be a Member of this Parliament , and I have raise the issue time and time again .
Commissioner , we shall continue to raise the issue , a Article 158 , paragraph 1 , of the Treaty of Amsterdam provide for an integrated policy for island .
therefore , the Commission should address the issue once and for all .
the time have come to implement the programme , and so Member States should also assume their responsibility and do their job properly .
a for u in Parliament , I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which be sign in May .
I be absolutely certain that this code will be observe and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the development and detail concern the implementation of the programme .
Mr President , Commissioner , in this minute and a half I should like , first of all , to congratulate Mrs Schroedter .
I know many have already do so , but she have indeed earn our praise for be particularly open and attentive to proposal from all side , and I think it be this openness which have give her report the quality we see today .
I share the regret she express , namely that Parliament have become involved rather late in the day a regard these guideline , since by now the procedure for negotiation with the state be so far advanced that I can not see this report have any sort of immediate effect , which in my view be a pity .
consequently , I feel we must look to the future and establish guideline for the mid-term review in 2003 , and thus have an influence on the second phase of program set to follow 2003 .
in brief , I would like to say that we be enter the period when we be call upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006 , which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenge to face .
the first be the harmonisation of national development policy and regional development policy .
subsidy be not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public service be lack .
we must ask ourselves a fundamental question : how can we ensure that Union policy interface with the subsidiary national policy for regional development ?
the second challenge be that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical term .
these be two area of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve u .
finally , in this time of natural disaster , I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds .
a you know , it be up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation .
Europe should not be completely absent , a the state tend to want .
public opinion and the press nowadays accuse u of be unavailable to give a response , even though we be go to be fund a large proportion of the national operation .
I think we should be capable of say this loud and clear .
I also think we should ensure , or ask Member States to ensure , that there be some publicity give to European aid whenever it be use to repair damage cause by natural disaster or accident .
Mr President , the priority give to financial and monetary criterion reinforce the increase in inequality of every shape and form .
a far a French planning expert be concern , for example , the most probable scenario today be that of the entrenchment of regional disparity within each country .
well , the Structural Funds have help to apply a brake to this process .
our project of a Europe that aim to satisfy social need envisage the convergence of living condition towards the highest common denominator .
it implementation would certainly require extend the scope of redistribution instrument such a the Structural Funds .
what we be propose specifically be a unified capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the fund use to support the harmonisation of social protection system and the reduction of work hour at European level .
the Commission , however , though bound to issue guideline , do so only reluctantly and in a vague manner .
the report put forward today re-establishes it place in the political sphere .
it be one of the step towards a policy of employment and sustainable development .
this be what persuade u to vote in favour of it .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
over the come year , face with the challenge of globalisation and eastward enlargement , Europe will , more than ever before , require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise it economy .
to this end , Europe a a whole , and each Member State individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resource and capacity , include the Structural Funds .
for this to be possible , what we need from the European Commission be not just good intention , but clearer guideline and a firm commitment to monitor the way these resource be use by the Member States .
for example , in recent year Italy have have problem in utilise the Structural Funds , mainly because of excessive bureaucracy , insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operator at local level .
there be , therefore , two point to which I would like to draw the Commission & apos ; s attention.Firstly , we need to make the best possible use of consultation a a mean of ensure proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operator in decision-making , precisely so that imbalance and inequality can be avoid .
secondly , a genuine effort be require to make administrative procedure simpler and more transparent , since , they be all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicate , to the point of hinder access to the Funds.This be something about which European small and medium-sized business , in particular , tend to complain .
I will conclude , Mr President , by say that the failure of the Commission & apos ; s communication to focus on territorial pact and , especially , method of combat unemployment among woman and young people , be cause for serious concern .
Mr President , like my colleague Mr Evans , it be a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue , especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom , the West Midlands , which have hitherto benefit from Objective 2 funding in particular .
but the report before the House tonight be a prime example of how , if we be not very careful , we can produce very grandiose-sounding idea that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them .
the report itself be well-intentioned but , a so often when we deal with these issue , lack clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability .
that be why I and my Group be propose three key amendment and addition to the text , not to take anything away from the proposal , but to make it more relevant to those whom it be there to guide .
I would like to explain our thinking here .
firstly , we be concern with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds .
past experience dictate that , a the elected representative of the European taxpayer , we should , and indeed must , demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money , hence our amendment and addition relate to achieve what be know a & quot ; value for money & quot ; indicator in the grant-giving process .
next , we all too often see vast sum of money be spend on project whose outcome will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period .
but at the mid-way point or end of that period there be no effective way of terminate the project if it have not prove successful .
our addition therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategy so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing cost which be often load onto the taxpayer , but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throw good money after bad .
finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the fund be disburse .
there should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality a a perspective within the funding equation .
also the type of project fund need to be shift away from small-scale revenue-based project , which be hard to monitor , towards capital scheme where , in the majority of case , the benefit be there for all to see .
that way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these fund and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in area where such project be locate will be diminish and the European Parliament will show how seriously it take the need for such reform .
I urge the House to support these change .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report , which be a meticulous and substantive piece of work .
the European Union & apos ; s structural and cohesion policy be , without doubt , essential tool for create the right condition with a view to tackling and reduce the level of economic and social disparity between the region .
despite the step take thus far , these level be still very high , and be unacceptably high a regard unemployment .
these policy objective can only be achieve through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guideline .
let u not forget that when these policy be effective , they also benefit European citizen by directly improve their quality of life .
let u not forget either that greater consideration should be give to the island and remote region of the European Union because their geographical location be a hindrance to their economic and social development , unless of course the Commission be intend to build bridge or underwater tunnel link them to the European mainland .
in closing , I would like to point out that the structural policy a a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to change circumstance and thereby respond to the new challenge and opportunity of the new millennium , for which we all hope for the best .
Mr President , Mrs Schroedter & apos ; s report undoubtedly contain several important observation , and I would like to congratulate her on that .
however , I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community & apos ; s regional policy .
quite briefly , structural policy do not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way , rather it aggravate it .
the agricultural economy and agricultural region have be irreparably damage by the exist regional policy , which have have dramatic consequence on employment level in rural area and on the living condition of farmer , particularly in the South .
regional disparity be become much more marked within the Member States .
if we examine the data present in the sixth periodic report , we will see that the last decade have witness a proliferation of regional disparity .
little consideration , if any at all , have be give to the great problem face the island region of the Union whose shortcoming a regard infrastrucutres structure , transport , communication and energy have result in their gradual depopulation .
the Union & apos ; s economic and social policy be just a much to blame for that a it regional policy .
a large section of the Union & apos ; s population have strongly condemn this policy for be dangerous and anti grass-roots .
unfortunately , the new guideline seem to be head in the same direction and there be no sign that thing will change once they have be implement .
Mr President , I would like to say a few word in order to highlight two point make in these report which be of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union .
the first be the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .
we be concern to hear news that the Commission be take this objective le seriously .
we still feel that economic and social cohesion be one of the Union & apos ; s fundamental objective .
secondly , I agree with what have already be say on the issue of the island and I would also like to bring the outermost region to your attention .
in future , we would like to see greater ambition apply to the subject of the outermost region such a , in my country , the island of the Azores and Madeira .
I would like to ask if the Commission be able to enlighten u on the reason for the delay in the Commission & apos ; s report on the outermost region , which have be long await by Parliament ?
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur , not least for be willing to include in the report the suggestion we make .
Mr President , Commissioner , the guideline be intend to help steer the Member States towards achieve the reform objective contain in the programme .
however , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the Commission & apos ; s proposal in this respect be reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measure within the scope of the various policy area .
nonetheless , their true purpose be to give direction and to set priority .
I be particularly in favour of a propose amendment table by my Group to paragraph 10 , to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the project .
I should be very grateful , Mrs Schroedter , if you would actually include this propose amendment in the part relate to subsidiarity in your positive deliberation .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we uphold unanimously the criterion that it be of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the intervention of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which be work for a better opportunity for job for the unemployed and for equality between men and woman .
unfortunately , the excellent Schroedter report do not take account of this criterion , despite the fact that there be considerable evidence to show - a we shall see later in the Berend report - how , in fact , these fund be provide splendid assistance to the most backward region in order to bridge the gulf that separate them from Europe & apos ; s most highly-developed region .
they be grow , but only in term of GDP .
they be increase in competitiveness but they be not all experience an increase in wealth because there be no increase in employment and there be still difference in employment opportunity between region .
Commissioner , please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it a a matter of priority , because this be our citizen & apos ; greatest problem .
please take account , in strategic term , in the revision and in the allocation of reserve , of employment need , because this , fundamentally be what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require .
Mr President , it be important that the guideline head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programme of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so a to ensure sustainable development and job creation , particularly for woman and young people , and ensure a balance be strike between economic and social policy and regional policy .
it be particularly important to address those serious issue concern urban area , employment in rural area , aid to agricultural region and equal development opportunity for the island of the European Union and for the Greek island which , of course , comprise half of the island of the Union , a stipulate in Article 158 of the Treaty .
cohesion policy need to be strengthen further because a Europe which totally disregard the standard of living in it region can neither be reliable or viable .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I would like to express my great interest in listen carefully to the comment , occasional criticism and suggestion that some of you have just make in your speech with reference to Mrs Schroedter & apos ; s report .
so , lady and gentleman , I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guideline before mention the principal comment and criticism that you , Mrs Schroedter , and the various Members of this House , have make .
regard the role and structure of these guideline , Mr Hatzidakis , Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mention that the purpose of these guideline be to assist national and regional authority in prepare their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1 , 2 and 3 a well a their link with the Cohesion Funds .
this mean put forward the Commission & apos ; s priority , base on past experience in implement the programme , a well a current Community policy relate to structural operation .
the objective be that these priority should contribute to the better use , to the optimum and efficient use , a some of you have wish , of Community involvement , include , Mr Bradbourn , use , if necessary , the performance reserve which be specifically intend to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies .
when I speak of optimum utilisation , I be refer both to the national and regional level .
and so , Mr Seppänen , I shall also mention at this point , speaking of the national level , the link with the Cohesion Fund .
this be the purpose of these guideline .
regard their content , a you know , lady and gentleman of this House , they be focus on three strategic priority that your rapporteur point out very clearly but , at the same time , very passionately , a I understand her presentation just now .
the first priority be to improve the competitiveness of regional economy in order to create , in all sector , but especially in the private sector , a Mr Berend say , the maximum number of serious , worthwhile and permanent job , the competitiveness of regional economy , all regional economy , and in particular , Mr Evans , that of Wales , but not only of Wales .
and , because there be a number of you who have just point out what appear to you to be an omission , let me also add the regional economy of the European region handicap by their distance from the centre , be they remote region , island region or , of course , the most remote region which be , naturally , the most distant .
perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro , who ask me about this , that , a I write to the president of each of these most remote region , the Commission do indeed request an extension of several week before publish it anticipated report .
concern the most remote region , it be only quite belatedly that we receive the memorandum from the various government , but this be not necessarily an excuse , just an explanation .
we must therefore take these memorandum into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work .
I myself take part in a meeting of the most remote region on 23 November and , within the College , we consider that we would need several more week before be able to produce a report that deal appropriately with the extremely serious problem and live up to the expectation of these most remote regions.I would thank you for your understanding in this matter .
so that be the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economy .
the second priority , which several of you have stress , Mr Puerta in particular , but there be others , not that I be mention them in any order of priority , be the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment , particularly by raise the profile of human resource far more so than in the past .
in fact , the guideline take two horizontal principle into account.The first be rural development , and let me say , Mrs Schroedter , that I be include in rural development the matter of sustainable transport , an issue I have be involve in personally for a long time .
these be the reason why the guideline be present accord to thematic priority , since they must be take into consideration , under each of the objective , to different extent in accordance with the specific situation of each of the Member States and region .
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comment you have make , lady and gentleman , and firstly on procedure .
it be true that consultation with Parliament have only come about at a late date .
let me remind you that when the guideline be adopt by the Commission , in the form of a draft in February 1999 , in line with a new procedure intend to make it easier to present comment on this text , my predecessor , Mrs Wulf-Mathies , present them to Parliament immediately .
due to the election to the European Parliament take place around this time , however , Parliament be not able to undertake it examination of these guideline until after the text have be definitively adopt , in July 1999 .
here in this Chamber , lady and gentleman , among you , I wish to assure you that in the negotiation for the programme which be only just begin - Mr Hatzidakis ask me a question about this - a far a Member States be concern , your observation will certainly be take into consideration .
and let me assure you , furthermore , that when the Commission adopt the guideline with what we call the mid-term review in mind , in line with the regulation , then the point of view of this House , a express in this report , will also be take into account .
now to the form.On the subject of the role of the guideline , Mrs Schroedter , you point out that this be the context in which guideline on a number of European objective , often very precise one , should be provide .
I shall not list them all , but they include implement intersectoral policy , increase efficiency in the use of public fund , assist the various partner in draw up regional or national programming together , etc.The Commission take note of these , but several of these guideline or these question be relate more to other document , such a the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document .
draw to a close , I should like to focus on a number of challenge which you reiterate , Mrs Schroedter .
I be think , for example , of the idea that these guideline be not specific enough in their recommendation .
this claim that your report make must be see in the context of last spring & apos ; s negotiation .
the Commission keep to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulation , which stipulate that the aim of these guideline be to provide Member States with broad , indicative guideline on relevant and agree Community policy .
I actually quote the text itself , in quotation mark .
moreover , the guideline may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessment which must be the tool use to specify priority and the effectiveness of these programme .
you then mention , Mrs Schroedter , the section of the guideline relate to urban and rural development , point out that urban development be not sufficiently take into consideration .
I find the opposite the case .
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attache , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .
indeed , I have occasion recently to say a much to all the minister responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere .
a regard rural development , which a number of you bring up , particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez , the guideline be in line with the twofold objective mention by your rapporteur : a strong agricultural sector link with increased competitiveness in rural area , but also protection of the environment and Europe & apos ; s rural heritage .
it must , however , be stress that the guideline under discussion be relate only to the Structural Funds , whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society a a priority .
and indeed , on the subject of the balance of rural society , let u not forget that there be also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section , aim at promote reform in European agriculture and support the multifunctional aspect of agriculture .
at this stage , I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrate into the programming for Objective 2 rural area , in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section be for Objective 1 region .
in any event , I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter .
I shall therefore reserve the right , if you permit , sir , to give you my own opinion , which , to a great extent , match your own recommendation regard what action we might take to combat the oil spillage use Objective 2 .
I shall remind you that the Commission be go to be approve the Objective 2 zoning plan for France , Sweden , Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow .
we shall then have an appropriate tool for work , particularly in the majority of the region affect by the storm .
indeed , this be my reason for pay a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French department which have be severely disable by the storm .
I be very pleased with the level of support offer by your House to the Commission in establish these guideline , which have be submit to the Member States for information when establish their own programme .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
social and economic situation and development of the region of the Union
the next item be the debate on the report ( A5-0107 / 1999 ) by Mr Berend , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the region of the European Union & # 91 ; SEC ( 99 ) 0066 - C5-0120 / 99 - 1999 / 2123 ( COS ) & # 93 ; .
Mr President , Commissioner , this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the region of the European Union constitute a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlight the progress make in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report .
I consider , however , that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development level in Europe offer a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and , unfortunately , this be often the message take up in the press and in some speech .
the Commission report generally relativise this observation , particularly when it refer to the social and economic situation of some region of the Union in which I have a special interest , by which I mean the French overseas department and , more generally , the most remote region .
in this respect , I be pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism have adopt one of my amendment call on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in it next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote region and , more specifically , to consideration of the impact of the measure shortly to be adopt under new Article 299 ( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
finally , in my view , this sixth periodic report present interest argument from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe , particularly when it outline the importance of relation between the central area of Europe and it more remote region .
even if the Commission be still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion , it periodic report demonstrate the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union & apos ; s structural policy and within the scope of the approach initiate by the SEC .
Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agree with the report that Mr Berend have just present and congratulate the author , both on the quality of his conclusion and on his flexibility , which ensure that the different group be able to incorporate amendment in committee .
the European Commission & apos ; s sixth report present very valuable conclusion .
I shall summarise two of those highlight by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative .
the first be that important advance have be make in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have be a major , although not decisive , factor in reduce regional inequality .
the negative conclusion be that the great effort make have be more efficient in harmonise the European region & apos ; GDP and productivity than in harmonise it level of unemployment .
it be therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation .
this , Commissioner , be the first commandment for the coming period .
thus , Mr President , I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission , a other speaker have do , to take good note of the conclusion of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006 .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for have take due account of the propose amendment while the committee be debate it .
the sixth periodical report give a basis for assess the implementation of the Union & apos ; s regional policy aim .
the report show that growth have be uneven , despite all our effort .
very rapid growth be continue in Central Europe .
the strongest regional centre also continue to grow faster than the general European average , whereas many southern European and northern area be develop considerably more slowly .
we now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy be not produce the desired result in all area .
be the reason bureaucracy or be it because insufficient notice have be take of interregional difference , long distance , climate that be too cold or too hot , sparse population and austere condition ?
how can the Union respond to the challenge of global development in a way that the le developed area can remain a part of that development ?
it be also important to discover what the effect of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union & apos ; s more remote area .
the Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility .
some Member States have be in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional fund when regional aid come via the Union have be increase .
this have chip away at the result that regional policy have produce .
in the future , we must also develop indicator so that measure can be target at the right time at the right place .
for example , uncontrolled migration have not be give sufficient consideration .
in this connection , too , weight have to be give to the decisive importance of SMEs a employer and force behind regional development .
it be absolutely essential that company in area develop more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how .
our Group be in favour of adopt this report .
Mr President , Commissioner , the European Union & apos ; s regional policy have , until now , not be able to interpret , in any significant way , the exist difference in our inhabitant & apos ; income .
we have a serious situation in which in the European Union today , there be a genuine link between unemployment and poverty , a demonstrate by the very worrying fact that unemployment have reach , on average , 23.7 % in the region worst affect , region which also happen to be poor area , whilst in the 25 region with the lowest unemployment , correspond to the richer area , unemployment stand at just 4 % .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Berend & apos ; s report be precisely in line with the strategy determine by the European Commission inasmuch a the question of increase competitiveness be bring right to the fore .
the overarch objective of the structural fund such a job creation , boost equality of opportunity , increase the sustainability of employment and development , be only mention in passing .
this attitude appear to me to be unjustified.I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be place on these point in the seventh periodic report .
this do not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness , particularly a I myself be an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region , that be in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany , and be only too aware of the problem and concern of small and medium-sized enterprise .
it be absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measure be introduce in the Objective 1 Regions , that be to say job creation measure , special programme for support employment opportunity for woman and initiative to help people set up their own business .
they be support by appropriate European Union structural fund activity .
support only the competitiveness of company will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development , simply because there be no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions .
after all , the knowledge that economic development alone do not help to combat unemployment substantiate the fact than an increase of at least 3 % in gross domestic product be need to create any additional job at all .
concentrate to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy be not the answer .
and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and , to a lesser extent , in rationalisation .
it be imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we be to have any chance at all of improve the social situation in these area .
the situation vary to an enormous degree throughout the region .
in other word , what be need be a number of accompany measure if anything at all be to be accomplish there .
for example , these would be measure for vocational training , for further education , for re-integrating people who have already be exclude from the production process , for the flexibilisation of work time and working time arrangement , in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspect and perhaps also to promote employment opportunity for woman again .
Mr President , my compliment to the rapporteur for his in-depth report .
the key goal of the structural fund be to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the region within the European Union .
by stimulate a diversity of investment , the European Union be endeavour to increase the GDP per caput and to boost employment .
from the sixth periodic report on the region , one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentive do not always have the desired effect .
the effort make in order to drive up the GDP per caput in Objective 1 region do not always result in such an increase , not really a satisfying result over a period during which , certainly over the past couple of year , there have be economic growth .
a indicate by the rapporteur , the effect of the structural measure , on the other hand , be minimal a far a employment be concern .
some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid be therefore call for .
also , the observation that the disparity between region within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raise serious question .
Mr President , it therefore seem worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authority , especially in connection with boost employment .
it be , after all , they who have most knowledge about the region which fall under their remit .
by allow them to develop tailor-made plan for the relevant region and , if necessary , tie this in with financial aid , a higher return can be achieve .
surely this must be the ultimate goal .
I be therefore in favour of the Commission delegate the practical detail and implementation of measure to the Member States and region .
follow on from this , it be probably also more meaningful , with regard to the financial aid to region , to give Member States more say anyway .
by shift the criterion from the region to the Member States , we can avoid a great deal of problem later on .
finally , I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European country .
the report show that , in general , they be a long way behind EU country , especially in term of GDP per caput .
with the planned accession of a large number of these country in the foreseeable future , it be a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy.I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposal for reform sooner rather than later .
Mr President , Commissioner , follow close scrutiny of this report one can not escape the conclusion that it be possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part .
for example , whilst the disparity between the region have increase rather than decrease , there have be a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect .
equally , unemployment level in the worst affected region barely fell at all , indeed they rise in some case .
I wonder why it be that the structural fund be not employ more efficiently .
even the accumulation of money from the cohesion fund and the structural fund have fail to have the desired effect in all region and country .
since it be the declared aim of all politician throughout Europe to reduce unemployment , then one must pose the critical question a to whether the policy employ be the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the region by appropriate measure such a increased support for research and development , improvement in infrastructure and raise the level of training .
genuine structural reform and a competition-friendly taxation policy be the cornerstone of a successful economic base .
if we do not wish to stand accuse of pursue a cost-intensive structural policy that do nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measure draw up so far must be analyse .
we will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union have be a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of job and when there be a significant reduction in the unemployment rate .
Mr President , Commissioner , my thanks go to the rapporteur for handle this very important report , because development in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizen of Europe will judge that we have be successful in our work .
this issue , which have an impact on their everyday life , be a key issue a regard EU credibility .
it have to be concede that the EU have already aid , I would say quite magnificently , the development of poor country .
I remember what Portugal and Greece use to be like when I drive through those country for the first time twenty-five year ago .
in this connection , French speaker would speak of a & quot ; coup de chapeau & quot ; : in other word , I take my hat off to the EU .
the EU really deserve such a gesture , but difference between rich and poor area within country be still too great .
what be the result ?
people react by vote with their foot and go where they can earn a crust .
consequently , we have to build school , hospital , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many time over .
this be very costly and it also cause very great social problem .
most people , however , would like to live in the area in which they be bear and raise , if they be give the chance to , in other word , if there be work there .
we must give them this opportunity .
this be a moral obligation the EU and all of u have .
the solution , a I see it , lie in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship .
by entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business , but create will .
I mean the attitude where a person want to get on in life , whether he or she be an employee , the owner of a business or an official .
what be a fair society ?
one in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so a to make life a little easier for his or her child .
in this way , positive development of the region be also possible , because people will start business and will work if they be give the chance .
finally , I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America , where hard work be still in fashion and success be an indication of ability and not the object of envy , a it often be here in Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , a my time be limited , I shall get straight to the point .
firstly , let me make a statement of fact : the fruit of growth be not distribute equitably within the Union .
the most remote region , still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rate , offer one example of this .
in Reunion , for example , the rate be 37 % .
this be not a situation relate to the economic climate , however ; rather it be a structural problem , create by our remoteness , our insularity , in short , our own specific personality .
the principle of specific , exceptional treatment be envisage in Article 299 ( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such case .
it only remain to put this principle into practice .
the Commission document expect to be ready in December 1999 be delay until January , then February , and the initial thinking do not fill me with much optimism .
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission .
a regard taxation , state aid , the Structural Funds and defend our traditional product , practical measure characterise by dare and ambition must be plan a a matter of urgency .
if these do not materialise , then , unfortunately , convergence and cohesion will remain no more than word for u , and it be to be fear that the structural policy undertake in our region , despite the size of the amount commit , will end in failure .
Mr President , a all the previous speaker have do , I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report .
just like the previous report , this extremely competent and precise analysis , the recommendation it support and your own comment , lady and gentleman , shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we be involve with the programming of appropriation for 2000-2006 .
I should also like to make a few comment , firstly , Mr Berend , regard the assessment you have make of this sixth periodic report .
you point out the quality of the report and you even write , if I be not mistake , that it mark a real improvement in comparison with previous report .
on behalf of all the official of the Commission and my predecessor , Mrs Wulf-Mathies , I must inform you that we be very alert to the evaluation make by this House and by yourself .
the Commission be certainly very anxious to ensure , Mr Berend , that this sixth periodic report should show that progress have be make and a threshold cross in term of the quality of the analysis submit to you .
I be think in particular of the content of chapter 2.1 of this report , where the Commission examine in greater detail the economic definition of regional competitiveness and attempt to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be support , improve and influence by factor which some of you - Mr Markov , just now , and Mrs Raschhofer - stress very forcefully .
I be think of technological research and development , infrastructure provision and quality , human resource potential , small and medium-sized business and direct investment from abroad .
so much for the quality .
I do not wish to spend time right now , Mr Berend , go into detail regard my opinion of the general point which your House have already endorse .
let me just itemise them : the first point concern the usefulness of the conclusion of this report in draw up the priority of the new regional policy , particularly for the negotiation of program document with the Member States .
secondly , partnership , a subject which a number of you stress , the role of local and regional authority , the private sector , both side of industry , association and local community action group .
regard this problem of partnership , I shall be extremely attentive to ensure that the term of the Structural Funds regulation be apply properly .
thirdly , the need to develop the employment side of growth , even though I be aware , a Mr van Dam just say , that the prime responsibility be that of the Member States , and that , when we speak of the responsibility of Member States , and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy , we must clearly establish what sort of period we be work in .
Mr Fruteau state just now that the fruit of growth be distribute inequitably .
Mr Fruteau , we at least need to recognise that there be growth , and that we be not work in a period of stagnation or recession , a have be the case in the past .
you will tell me that situation of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike .
I agree with your analysis .
when there be growth , it must be better distribute , but a matter that be even more difficult and which more seriously affect the region handicap by their remoteness , be they the most remote or island region , be the lack of growth which generally characterise the last two decade .
fourthly , a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stress just now , the promotion of an equal opportunity policy for woman and young people .
fifthly , the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses.Mr Vatanen express this most forcefully just now .
finally , the positive effect on national administration of the system of management of the Structural Funds , the motif of official in manage these fund , even if it be occasionally complicate , and the importance of once again make improvement to the procedure for the evaluation , follow-up and supervision of the Commission .
in relation to this , I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authority on this question of the evaluation of procedure for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds .
I should like to mention a few specific point .
Mr Berend , you express a wish that zone should be implement quickly .
well , we be come to an end of the zoning phase .
tomorrow , the Commission be to decide on the matter for four more country and very soon , I hope , it will be Italy & apos ; s turn .
you may therefore be satisfy on this point , since zoning will have be complete for all the country affect by Objective 2 .
regard the informal economy you mention in your report , I be well aware that the analysis and production of statistic on this subject be dependent on the reliability of data and , a Mr Cocilovo mention , there be clearly a problem with the reliability of this data .
to a certain extent , they be take into account in the statistic on GDP and labour force survey and , in any case , I wish to point out the effort which Eurostat be make and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistic .
Mr Berend , you also mention , a do Mr Aparicio Sánchez , the lack of reform in the fishery sector .
on this point which be of personal interest to me , let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this do not necessarily mean that it be an insignificant area - and it concentration in a limited number of region do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context .
this type of sectoral analysis pertain rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries , under Commissioner Fischler .
nonetheless , I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which , no doubt , will respond better to these concern .
several of you mention point which must be include in the second report on cohesion , and your rapporteur mention some of these .
and finally , there be the cross-border aspects.I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendation on all these point .
finally , I should like to mention a few political conclusion which you be , in any case , familiar with , but whose main element I should like to reiterate .
lady and gentleman , considerable progress have be make on the road to real convergence , particularly for the four cohesion country , but also frankly , Mr Pohjamo , for the Objective 2 region which have suffer some delay in term of development , especially regard infrastructure .
this be my first point regard the policy .
my second point regard the policy be a follow : the Structural Funds have make , and continue to make , a significant contribution to the convergence process .
all the macroeconomic model we be work on show that , over the last decade , more than one third of the convergence achieve in the region whose development be lag behind would not have take place without the Structural Funds .
now to my fourth point regard the policy ; enlargement of the Union , the great political and humanist project of the come year for our institution , the major challenge , too , for the European policy on cohesion , a point which Mr van Dam highlight .
I shall say that something be already take shape in Berlin and in the financial instrument available to u which may be a policy on cohesion for the first country who be go to join u .
I be think in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument , which I shall be responsible for implement in the next few week .
you see , lady and gentleman , we have only just initiate the new programming and we be already consider together the impact of the Union & apos ; s enlargement on our structural policy .
this sixth periodic report which you assess a positive on the whole , Mr Berend , be a good basis for our thinking , for u all and for myself .
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the think which we be already engage in with regard to the forthcoming guideline , a well a for the proper application of the guideline for the period 2000-2006 .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
( the sitting be close at 8.25 p.m . )
adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
the Minutes of yesterday & apos ; s sit have be distribute .
be there any comment ?
Mr President , I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter refer to in the Minutes .
I refer to item 11 on the order of business .
firstly , I believe the issue raise by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme be sufficiently important for other speaker who wish to comment briefly on that matter to have be accommodate .
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and vote against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group .
the second point I would like to make - and which I would have wish to make yesterday before the vote - be that this Parliament , a other speaker remark yesterday , can only really have an effect if it work in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission .
there be one basic lesson I would like u to learn from this .
when there be major set-piece debate schedule between this House and the European Commission in the future , we should clear all of our line on what be our mutual expectation at least one full work month in advance .
there need firstly to be clarity between all of the group of this House and then between this House and the Commission .
we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution create an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationship .
look at some of the press report of last Friday , I believe that the Commission and it President exercise commendable self-restraint in the way they comment publicly .
that be something for which I have a deep appreciation .
I hope that we will learn the lesson and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe be found on a misapprehension a to what be expect rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institution .
it should not be dramatise into something more than that .
thank you very much , Mr Cox .
I understand what you be say .
we have take note of this .
Mr President , concern item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business , we agree yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today & apos ; s agenda .
however , it be withdraw from the Committee on Budgets last night without be discuss or vote on .
it therefore need to be withdraw from today & apos ; s agenda .
Mr Wynn , that make sense .
the report be hereby withdrawn from the agenda .
Mr President , regard Mrs Lynne & apos ; s comment yesterday about health and safety in this building , I presume she be talk about the drain because there be a dreadful smell of drain on the fifth floor in the Tower .
this need to be look into because it be clearly an indication that something be seriously wrong .
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly , but this be a serious problem .
Mrs Ahern , we have take note of this .
I would ask you to bring this specific case , which have to do with the ventilator on a particular floor , to the attention of the Quaestors , who be , in fact , responsible for the matter .
we will also pass this on to our service , however .
thank you very much .

Mr President , Commissioner , today we be engage in an important debate about the European Union & apos ; s competition policy .
we be debate a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopoly law , that be Mr von Wogau & apos ; s report , and it be far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have give u reason to believe .
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission & apos ; s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remain to be see a to whether we be truly justified in use the term & quot ; modernisation & quot ; to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper , or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression & quot ; retrograde step & quot ; .
however , we be also discuss the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998 , and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter .
but , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper .
it be all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy .
on read both Commission document , one learn that 1998 be the year in which the modernisation proposal introduce in 1997 be pursue and even partially complete , which be something our own ongoing parliamentary work have teach u .
allow me to make two fundamental comment at this juncture.As the competent authority , the Commission , with it logically consistent approach , have again and again serve the cause of freedom of competition , not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprise concern .
it should continue along this path .
but , Commissioner , none of this be to become le complicated in future - one only have to think of the challenge pose by the enlargement of the Union , the deepening of the internal market , technological progress , globalisation .
indeed , it be not just about modernisation of Community law , more than anything it be about transparency of decision take in individual case , about the possibility of decision actually be able to implement decision , for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population & apos ; s acceptance , together with that of the political body and enterprise concern .
only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .
the competition report 1998 be not a bad foundation for this but , in fact , there be nothing that could not be further improve upon .
our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought , Commissioner , but there be one point that I would just like to go into now.Transparency and accountability belong together .
I do not wish to call the distribution of competence between the Commission and Parliament into question .
the Commission be the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role , for the sake of it own independence ; but Parliament be a supervisory body , and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one & apos ; s decision than a democratically-elected Parliament , indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion ?
here too we should continue along the path we have choose , strengthen and intensify it .
there be one thing I would like to make quite clear though.Parliament be a legislative body , but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matter of competition law , of all thing , be truly scandalous .
therefore , I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area .
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful case , even give the Treaty status quo .
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in support u in our call for codecision in legislative procedure .
this will be a good test a to whether there be reasonable cooperation between the two institution .
with all due respect for the principle of competition , competition be not , however , an end in itself .
competition be an instrument and do not always produce ideal solution .
at the end of the day , one of the fundamental tenet of economic theory be that the market be fail in many respect and anyone who take issue with this be nothing more than an ideologue .
competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resource and fact .
but optimum efficiency do not necessarily come about of it own accord .
framework condition be indispensable when it come to prevent abuse , monopoly law be one example .
but on the whole , this only serve to prevent abuse ; framework condition alone can not achieve socially legitimate goal in isolation .
competition yes , restriction in state aid where necessary and where possible .
however , since state aid form the lion & apos ; s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like , regardless of Mr Jonckheer & apos ; s report , to say one more thing about it .
it be certainly possible , indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be give to small and medium-sized enterprise involve in research and development for the purpose of educate them in regional and environmental policy .
indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provide for such purpose , provide it do not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition .
this be precisely the area where it be even more important than it be in monopoly and merger law for decision to be comprehensible .
it be not just that we should pillory state aid ; rather our approach must be one of draw distinction and we must assess the different type of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objective .
my last comment be intend not so much for the Commission a for the Members of the Group of the European People & apos ; s Party .
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today be an opinion on the Commission & apos ; s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community be authorise under Articles 87 , 88 and 89 of the Treaties .
the Commission report be essentially a descriptive report detail the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sector , accord to various typology , such a the method of financing and the objective pursue .
to put it plainly , the level of state aid declare , roughly speak , be generally stable during the period under discussion and come to approximately 1.2 % of Community GDP or more or le the equivalent , coincidentally , of the Community budget for one year .
this be the case , there be considerable disparity between state , which may be measure in various way , such a , for example , a a percentage of added value and per wage earner .
I think it be also interest to add state aid and Community aid , which may be assimilate in some way into state aid .
this clearly show that it be the four country which benefit from the Cohesion Fund , among other thing , which come at the top of the list .
this be the case , let me now come to the proposal make in the report .
the Commission can only collate and analyse the data provide by the Member States .
it be therefore down to the state and region to ensure the quality of the data provide , and our committee considers that additional effort must be make in this respect .
it be in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example , have champion the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid , accessible via the Internet .
have better , more detailed information available , particularly with regard to the objective pursue and the result record , must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner study of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policy .
and insofar a such study already exist , to publish more openly it own comment with regard to the objective of the Treaties , which be not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy , but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion .
by stress , primarily , the quality of the information provide , our debate in committee , and hence the report which it be my honour to present to you , avoid a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid be , in absolute term , either too high or not high enough .
this be the case , various amendment to the rapporteur & apos ; s initial draft report be adopt in committee , particularly highlight the need for effective reimbursement of aid find to be illegal a well a the establishment of a league table of result .
seven amendment have be retabled for this plenary sitting .
most of them be an expression of the political difference among ourselves regard the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid , in view of the inadequacy , acknowledge or not , of private investment alone , the market failures or inadequacy of the market .
there be in particular one amendment , let me point out , concern the energy sector , which , in my capacity a rapporteur , I see a particularly important .
I should like to conclude this presentation , Commissioner , by stress two thing : firstly , a concern of the member of the committee and , secondly , a demand of our committee .
the concern involve the pre-accession process for the country of Central and Eastern Europe , in term of competition policy and state aid .
this be undoubtedly a complex issue , and one where we should like to see the Commission inform u of the latest development in the matter , particularly in term of the capacity of the economy involve in the accession process to comply with competition rule and , a far a state aid be concern , the need , in all probability , to have specific rule on state aid use to assist restructuring of their sector .
and finally , in conclusion , our demand regard the future responsibility of the European Parliament in the matter we be discuss , competition policy and state aid , in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference .
a you know , Commissioner , our report argue that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid .
Mr President , Commissioner , my contribution to today & apos ; s debate concern the steel aid code , that be the state aid in Europe grant in accordance with this code and which be assess by the Commission .
there be a total of 27 case in 1998 and the Commission submit it own report on these .
the ECSC Treaty be due to expire shortly .
hence , what we must focus on today be the question a to how state aid be to be manage in future .
the European Commission & apos ; s decision , which feature in the report , be welcome by the European Parliament , a be the decision to ask for the money back in specific case , thus apply Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty .
the competitiveness of the European steel industry also form the subject of the Commission & apos ; s most recent communication , which we have not yet debate in Parliament .
a in other sector , the general ban on state aid accord to Article 87 ( 1 ) of the EC Treaty also apply to the iron and steel industry .
accord to this article , state aid be irreconcilable with the common market , in principle.Exemptions be only permit in precisely defined case .
under Article 88 , the Commission be oblige to supervise state aid .
in 1998 , the largest case concern the supply of company capital total EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany .
furthermore , the Member States must give the Commission advance warn with regard to their intention concern state aid .
the rule pertain to the steel industry be draw up on 18 December 1996 .
these stipulate that state aid can only be award to the steel industry in particular , precisely-defined case i.e . those involve aid for research and development , aid for environmental protection , social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprise cease trade altogether .
in addition , there be a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece .
however , there be obviously problem with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few year that be not bring fully to bear in the report .
a far a Parliament be concern , it be important for u to waste no time in get down to a debate on the regulation that be to succeed this state aid code once it have expire .
there must be no watering-down of the exist principle underlie the steel aid code .
no one want an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe .
this would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry have undergone consolidation in the past few year .
consequently , Parliament believe it be necessary for the steel aid code to be amend in the light of the industry & apos ; s claim about unequal treatment , and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulation .
we all know that so far the Council have drag it foot with regard to follow-up regulation of this kind .
the reason for this be that people be under the impression that once the steel aid code expire , they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission & apos ; s supervision .
we therefore demand that once the Treaty expire , steel aid must be regulate by a Council regulation accord to Article 94 , for that be the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity .
this be the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not cover by the code .
a Council regulation that be directly applicable law must also be observe by the regional government .
what we need to avoid do in the future be compromise competition condition and disturb the balance in the market .
we also need to criticise the Commission & apos ; s practice of approve multiple aid package for steel enterprise which in their view , do not fall within the category of the code , even give the fact that the European Court of Justice approve this unequal treatment where certain individual decision be concern .
the Commission will be call upon , in a report that have yet to be compile for the year 1999 , to give a detailed explanation of it active role in the elaboration of restructuring plan and approve exemption , thus enable a proper assessment of the overall situation to be make .
once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have adopt the draft report unanimously with two abstention , I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity , which we have ourselves create , in plenary sitting .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , the internal market be not complete .
subsidy , monopoly and barrier to competition be still impede market and development alike .
national government provide subsidy and promise that this be the last time , but then it happen again .
subsidy distort allocation , both within and between country .
a successive phase out of State aid be require , and more and more market must be open up to competition .
this apply to those which have be turn into monopoly , both private and public .
public monopoly be , more often than not , phase out reluctantly .
increase competition and newly establish organisation should be able to provide significant benefit in term of welfare , include within the sphere of education , health care and social service .
public monopoly must be replace by competitive structure .
Europe must be modernise , make more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapt in such a way that it become a more competitive environment for consumer and company .
effective competition push price down and raise standard of living .
it be precisely upon price level that consumer policy have fail to focus sufficiently .
in fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .
the internal market be the basis for our work .
it legislation be to apply equally to all , to large and small country alike .
a systematic survey of the various national regulation be need if barrier to competition be to be dismantle .
the EU & apos ; s own regulation too may therefore need to be analyse .
the new model now be test by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the establish competition policy .
in order to be effective , it must be well anchor in the Member States & apos ; national authority .
in six month & apos ; time , it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation & apos ; s effect upon the Commission & apos ; s role .
the question of how best to make further progress have so far be solve through the idea of hold an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopt a broad perspective and involve representative of different interest .
this will provide the opportunity to establish new principle or to return to the more radical change which have be discuss .
there will also be the opportunity to find new common solution and to analyse amendment from the committee debate .
the law must be correctly apply in matter of competition .
wrongly apply competition policy may cause loss in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership , which be an important and basic principle we should stand up for .
we have a quite exciting debate in front of u .
a conference where the issue be properly debate will make it possible to straighten out misunderstanding , at the same time a perhaps improve upon certain point .
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their effort to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunity and new resource for our citizen .
in fact , in my own constituency of Stockholm , we have many good local example of increase supply and improve quality which have arise precisely because of exposure to competition in area which be previously total monopoly .
we would encourage a continuation of the open debate which have be strengthen in the course of consideration of the report by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay .
we hope that the legal point of view will also be accord the importance which be only reasonable in a state base on the rule of law .
Mr President , a a new Member I be pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today , even though there have be a delay .
I would like to begin by thank the rapporteur Mr von Wogau , Mr Langen , Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer , a well a the Commission , for their excellent cooperation .
competition be certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy be a success story ; take the energy and telecommunication sector , where there have be a demonstrable lowering of price and improvement in quality of service .
all this be to the good of the consumer .
but we have now arrive at a point where we need to develop competition policy further .
the Commission have put forward a new White Paper on this contain two key point : drop the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean le red tape and administration cost , at any rate .
at the same time , this change of system will also lead to more onus be place on the individual in the business world , of course .
it will no longer simply be a case of submit paper and have them approve ; for one thing , each person will have to take responsibility themselves , and that be probably why there be unease about this in other quarter .
however I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for le red tape .
the second point relate to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
if we be to create a culture of law in Europe , then there be no doubt that the law must be apply not only by the Commission , by central body , but also by national authority , by national court .
we be not discuss the fact that although every EU law be only ever decide on centrally , it be precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty .
it will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprise to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter .
the way to a European monopoly commission must be keep clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion .
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we be to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid be be grant , then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined .
however , when it come to what the future hold for competition , there be two issue dear to my heart .
one be subsidiarity .
we all hold the view that competition be vital to the economy and require there to be efficiency , and I believe we should also permit competition in the region .
competition between the region will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union .
I would cite , by way of example , the issue of job creation scheme , saving bank and regional bank , and Gütesiegel .
here , a region have , by it own effort , create a mean of market it own product .
this own initiative must not be destroy by European intervention .
I believe there be also a need to raise the de minimis regulation .
we should do everything within our power to force the region into a situation where they have to compete with each other .
my second point relate to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although I be not go to talk about market failure just now .
I have already refer to the regional and saving bank sector , but I would just like to focus on a matter one hear again and again in certain quarter .
these day , someone who live in an old people & apos ; s home be accommodate within the social field .
however , I could also regard them a a customer , and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the way in which the social field , that be evolve structure , stifle competition .
apart from that , I could refer to any customer , any sector , a customer , and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social field .
to conclude , I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity.I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow region and local authority to raise tax , they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe .
thank you very much , Mr Radwan .
I would like to congratulate you on what be refer to in German parliamentary-speak , inappropriately in your case , a a maiden speech .
Mr President , Commissioner , I be speak on behalf of my fellow Member , Robert Goebbels , who be unable to attend due to a political commitment .
within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , the Jonckheer report have give rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market .
a slim right-wing majority succeed in remove any reference to market failure .
even if the majority in this House be to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market , it would not make any difference to the real world .
economic relationship in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminate all public intervention in the market do not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resource .
while , since the dawn of time , the market have be the key forum for human interchange , it have never be perfect .
the market favour the short term and immediate profit .
on the market , the balance of power between supply and demand be generally to the detriment of the weakest party , consumer and worker .
in order to function , the market need rule .
the necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society .
we European Socialists be in favour of a market economy with a social purpose .
the market be not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition .
the European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operator , but public authority must define the rule and objective which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion .
finally , aid can enable restructuring , offer training , save job and thus know-how .
the main objective of the Union & apos ; s competition policy can not be to reduce the overall level of aid .
this aid must be align with the objective of the Union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .
the Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinder the internal market .
it would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid .
the Internet be not a product of the market , but the result of research finance by the American army .
the World Wide Web , which have enable the meteoric development of the information society , be develop by CERN in Geneva , once again with public aid .
the German Government & apos ; s intervention to save the Holzmann group be criticise a an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy .
President Duisenberg even attempt to attribute the weakness , the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism .
I do not hear Mr Duisenberg criticise the intervention of the American monetary authority to save the hedge fund , LTCM .
wish to save 60 000 job be , apparently , a sin against the market , but save capital do not seem to present any problem for the advocate of the free market .
public monies be use in order to repair the damage cause by international speculation , a be the case in Mexico , Asia and Brazil .
human labour , on the other hand , be consider to be a simple factor in the equation .
we Socialists reject the liberal & apos ; naïve optimism on this point .
we want a true culture of competition in Europe .
the state hand must still be clearly see to regulate the market and the Commission must act a judge .
Mr President , Commissioner , I want to begin by thank Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation .
I want to thank you , Commissioner Monti , for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that , a we enter the new millennium , you have an especially important role .
it be your job to tidy up the mess leave by national governments.These may well have grand vision when it come to competition policy , but their capacity to wreak havoc seem boundless .
let me mention the latest example we have see : Holzmann , a company which receive considerable aid from the German Government ; sawmill in former East Germany ; and , especially , aid to shipyard .
these be three area in which many Danish company be experience major problem and be be squeeze out of their market .
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these example show that some EU Member States be not in a position to restructure their economy and , to that extent , be help to undermine the value of the euro .
the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party have table 80 amendment in the committee , all concern state aid .
these be amendment which we believe will lead to transparency and openness , which be very important with a view to make the internal market work .
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleague on the committee for support the amendment table by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
a I say , our amendment concern transparency , and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urge the Commission to propose uniform criterion and condition for the type of state aid we consider to be lawful , specifically in order to ensure that company can predict what their situation will be .
another issue be that of what we be to do when state aid be declare unlawful .
how do we ensure that unlawful state aid be pay back ?
at present , there be no common rule in this area , and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonise the rule on repayment .
this be the way forward if we be to ensure uniform condition of competition .
finally , we propose keep both a register , a mention by a number of my fellow MEPs , and also a scoreboard show where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid .
you have show u the way , Mr Monti , with the single market scoreboard .
it be this which inspire u to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .
I very much hope that you , Commissioner Monti , will support these amendment , and I look forward to your comment and to find out where you stand on this matter .
to conclude , I want to welcome the Commission & apos ; s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work have be do .
but , a I have already mention , our override objective ought still to be those of transparency and openness .
there be still a need to tighten up in the area mention , and there be therefore good reason for continue to work resolutely towards solve the problem concern the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid .
this be especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union , and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who , in his report , have consider very thoroughly the problem associate with enlargement and with ensure that the applicant country be able to meet our criterion , a well a with ensure common condition of competition .
a Liberals and Greens , we clearly have different opinion on how the world should look , but we be well on the way to agreement a to our objective , and we shall try to find reasonable solution to our problem .
Mr President , Commissioner , there be just two question which must be answer .
be state aid to business or inter-company agreement legitimate in a market economy , and who must supervise these exception to the absolute rule of the market economy ?
regard the first point , we say quite clearly that , in order to take into consideration the requirement of sustainable development which the European Union have endorse , it be essential that , in some instance , there be state aid to business , be it in the form of tax exemption , special taxation or even direct aid .
it be also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreement and voluntary restraint agreement , since all these agreement make it possible to reduce the detrimental effect of competition on social or ecological requirement .
so our clear response be that , yes , such aid and such agreement be legitimate , but we say that every single one of these agreement must be expressly justify .
the von Wogau report propose refer supervision of the legitimacy of individual case to national level .
we feel this be relatively dangerous , but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission can not do everything .
we demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater power of investigation be grant to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exception after the fact .
Mr President , once again we be debate the European Union & apos ; s competition policy .
but let u stop to consider the circumstance in which this debate be take place and the conclusion to which it should bring u .
the override feature of today & apos ; s economy be massive merger and acquisition involve huge company with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational group .
should we not be discuss this issue ?
we need a competition policy which can and will introduce control on the activity of these private-sector monopoly .
certain sector of European industry , such a the shipbuilding industry , air transport and the steel industry , which have be hard hit by exist competition policy , have suffer tremendously .
they have lose their status , and a significant slice of the world market and hundred of thousand of worker have be make redundant .
when will we debate that ?
the scandalous concentration of power in sector of strategic importance be give speculative multinational group economies the size of entire state , and Member States of the Union at that .
and yet , we keep on weaken the public sector and we be ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualify public procurement contract place with public-sector corporation a state aid .
at the same time , unemployment be spiral a a result of the loss of hundred of thousand of job .
worker be face a massive attack on their employment and social right .
consumer see their standard of living be erode , poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most country in the Union be dismantle and dissolve in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition , in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interest of big business .
we consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and be totally oppose to it .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the course of this pivotal year , prior to the changeover to the single currency , the Commission have deploy every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment .
the competition policy have , a far a these resource permit , contribute to this event .
for our part , we remain staunchly oppose to the single currency which , far from bring u the advantage and flexibility of a shared currency , imprisons u in an artificial straitjacket , which have be impose on the people of Europe .
have say that , govern mean planning.It also mean be responsible and , in this new context which have be force upon u , competition law naturally have an essential role to play .
in this area , the Commission have give priority to a number of route of action : acting on the structure of market by actively combat anti-competitive practice , by refocus it department & apos ; supervisory activity only upon matter with a manifest Community interest and by affirm it intention to modernise competition law .
a regard state aid , it be essential to ensure that regulation be not make more complex , and the introduction of a public register , where all aid would be record , do not seem advisable to u since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempt to simplify bureaucratic constraint .
finally , on the subject of modernise the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty , we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be go in the right direction .
the Commission be , in fact , retain not only the power to take matter out of the jurisdiction of national authority , but clearly oblige the national jurisdiction to avoid dispute the decision of the Commission at all .
national state would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regard observance of the application of rule which they do not control .
in conclusion , I would say that while some measure be head in the right direction , we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which , if it be realise , would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the state .
Mr President , Commissioner , we have a basically positive view of the Commission & apos ; s White Paper on competition , particularly a regard the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation , but we be also puzzle by several thing .
in this respect , we should heed the word of von Eieck , and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni , who warn precisely against the risk of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policy .
state interference in the economy be , even today , still to blame for the most serious hindrance place in the way of the market , competition and freedom of choice for European user and consumer .
there be State aid for business - we have already discuss this , there be still a strong public presence in the economy - it be estimate that the Italian Treasury control 15 % of stock exchange capitalisation ; government and central bank place obstacle in the way of merger and acquisition ; and there have be much talk in recent week about Vodafone & apos ; s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann .
finally , Commissioner , we can not forget that large section of the economy be still firmly in the hand of the state , range from state television , which be fund on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer , and the Post Office , to some compulsory insurance scheme , include health and social welfare system , which be manage by inefficient state monopoly which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option .
Commissioner , I be quite familiar with the constraint impose by the Treaties , but I believe that , it must be emphasise once again that the European economy be find it hard to compete with the American economy , especially because of insufficiently open market and a lack of genuine competition .
what be be do may well be very important , but it be still not sufficient .
Mr President , a White Paper , by definition , be not something you can take or leave .
it be there to generate reaction and the White Paper have certainly succeed in do that .
it form a sound basis for discussion and be to be welcome in this sense .
I understand where the author be come from and I share their view .
I also assume that you , Commissioner , want to honour the reputation of , and the work put in by , your predecessor and that your office will pursue the same objective .
I can not imagine the Commission take initiative in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner , but I have my concern and question nevertheless .
firstly , these relate to the coherence of the policy & apos ; s application .
in general , I be a great defender of cultural diversity but not in term of competitiveness within the internal market .
the internal market need a uniform competition policy , not only in term of concept , but also in term of application .
it be true , there be some European regulation and interpretative statement on the way .
the Commission be also say to have the right of evocation and can give guideline to the national competition authority .
but I still wonder if we do not run the risk of end up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we be able to take two step forward .
so , I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the course outline from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible .
secondly , I understand the worry of industry regard legal certainty .
many dossier be currently be file with precisely this concern .
this instrument will fall by the wayside in future .
in the White Paper , you state that the Commission will still issue particular order which can be use a guideline , but what will your criterion be for grant such order one day but not the next ?
thirdly , I would like to know whether the Commission have look into the effect it new approach will have on industrial strategy .
I have particular concern regard the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection , a be already the case , one have get to admit , within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector .
fourthly , I would like to be inform of why the Commission do not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringement of the competition rule .
fifthly , with the pending enlargement , I wonder whether the candidate county will be able to play our game .
they be still in training , a it be .
what guarantee do we have that they will grow into first-class player in the league of the internal market ?
Sixthly and lastly , I would remind you of a point that I have already raise in my report on vertical restriction , namely the legal privilege of company lawyer .
if the Commission implement the White Paper objective , it seem to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal adviser will become more pronounced and hence even le acceptable .
be the Commission consider take any action to allow in-house lawyer in all Member States legal privilege ?
Commissioner , I be ask these question a a defender of the internal market and I hope that , in this sense , we be all partner and that the discussion between these partner do not remain sterile but can bear fruit .
Mr President , I would like , in begin my speech regard the White Paper , to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr von Wogau .
the fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists be very much in agreement with your report be clearly demonstrate by the fact that only one amendment have be present during this procedure .
we be , therefore , in agreement with the report , Commissioner , a well a the broad outline of the White Paper .
since the Treaty enter into force , Community law on competition have be one of the tenet of Community policy .
after almost forty year of be in force , these rule be begin to show sign of exhaustion.For this reason , modernisation be essential .
that modernisation come to be particularly necessary for five reasons.Firstly , the authorisation system ; secondly , decentralised application ; thirdly , procedural rule ; fourthly , judicial application ; and fifthly and finally , excessive red tape .
the system of individual approval need urgent reform , a be unanimously request by specialised company , academic and lawyer .
I have not attend a single forum of specialist in competition law which have not request a change to the system .
a system , such a the current one , which be capable of make so few decision , be they approval or prohibition , be something le than a valid system .
national competition authority be able to apply Articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 for some time .
however , they could not apply Article 81 ( 3 ) , which , to a certain extent , prevent the coherent application of Article 81 ( 1 ) .
you will know that there be currently two preliminary issue before the Court of Justice , both bring by German court , which question the feasibility of apply 81 ( 1 ) without be able to apply 81 ( 3 ) .
a reform of this point be therefore also necessary .
the procedure in the field of competition be basically contain in Regulation 1762 .
the voice in favour of it amendment be unanimous .
the fact that it do not establish a genuine procedure , that it do not establish time limit , that it do not regulate access for interested party to the file , or that the right to defence be not properly recognise , be factor which lead to the unanimous demand for reform .
the Court of Justice accept some time ago that Community competition law could be apply by the legal body of the Member States and in 1994 , the Commission publish a communication on this subject .
it be therefore necessary to facilitate this approach .
one of the most frequent criticism of Community competition law be it excessive red tape .
a a consequence of the continental legal tradition , consideration of whether certain agreement be anti-competitive or not depend more on an analysis of their clause than on their effect on the market .
it be therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis .
the White Paper intend to resolve these problem and we therefore support these proposal .
it be also true that we note certain deficiency which have come to light in the report .
amongst these , firstly , be the fact that , despite try to modernise Articles 81 and 82 , Article 81 and not Article 82 carry exclusive weight .
at the moment , with inter-company agreement and the privatisation of monopoly preserve dominant position and even consolidate them , the combating of abusive conduct be become particularly important .
secondly , Regulation 1762 must be repeal and replace with a new regulation .
for these reason , we be go to vote in favour of the report .
however , if some of the amendment be accepted , particularly those present by the PPE-DE Group , we would consider the report to be strip of it value and to have become an inconsistent document , lack in rigour and , in that event , we would reconsider our support .
Mr President , amongst the various issue be dealt with in this joint debate , I would like to comment on the one mention by Mr Berenguer , that be to say , the modernisation of competition policy , which be the subject of the Commission & apos ; s White Paper .
frankly , I believe that this modernisation have be satisfactory .
if it function well , if we be satisfied , if the Commission have basically act correctly , why the need for the modification ?
various argument have be present in it favour .
Mr Berenguer make a very accurate analysis , justify the need and the relevant reform for improve the dynamic of competition , but my concern be to ensure that the standard and criterion which will be apply through the corresponding administration in the Member States , be truly identical in all region .
because , if this be not the case , we will be face with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce element of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market .
in that event we would not have move forward , but rather backwards , in the application of competition policy in the Union .
Mr President , I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represent by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union , when compare to previous report .
I would also like to highlight the work carry out by the rapporteur , Mr Rapkay , who have dissect this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way .
I would also like to fully support his comment on the need to allow the region - such a the Basque Country , which I represent - a margin for action , by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity .
the only guarantee have be to seek prior favourable approval , through individual case , which will take more than six or eight month to resolve , an excessively long period , which simply lead to problem of a lack of flexibility , affect the generation of wealth and employment .
I therefore believe that something be miss and I suggest that we establish more regulation , lay down clear rule , which will benefit all of u : businesspeople , investor , worker and the citizen in general .
Mr President , I would like to stress that , in an age of significant technological change - just look at what be happen in the information technology sector and other sector such a energy and transport - safeguard competition will be of fundamental importance for our future .
from the point of view of economic growth , and therefore of increase employment and wealth , safeguard a competition policy in the Member States be become a crucial factor , and one that be certainly very important for our future .
this be why I give this report my full support .
recently , I have notice that the Commission have be work hard to ensure that this principal be respect in a proper and effective manner , precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility , both for product and for service .
I would emphasise that this be go to be extremely important for our future , for Europe & apos ; s economy , and , above all , for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general .
Mr President , for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy be at the core of achieve an effective single market across the whole of the European Union .
it therefore follow that any proposal which suggest major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examine .
the truth be that the single market be not yet complete .
during my six month a a Member of this Parliament , I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what be describe a the European project .
we daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe .
but all this , in effect , be so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacle which continue to block the operation of a true European single market .
that be the context in which I want to consider the Commission & apos ; s proposal .
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti .
we look to him a the man to root out cartel .
but he would recognise that , a for everybody else , we have to consider his particular proposal and subject them to rigorous examination.That be something that have be do by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs , Mr von Wogau .
I want to congratulate him , sadly in his absence , for the thorough and rigorous way in which he have undertake the preparation of his report - and also for put up with my be such a thorn in his side !
he mention earlier that the report be carry with a significant majority but not with my support .
so although I may not share his conclusion , I believe he have illustrate in his report many of the issue which the Commission must address .
the first be the potential for renationalisation of competition policy .
I know that the Commission be set against this , but the potential exists .
I remain worried about the capacity of national court and the capacity of the national competition authority .
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process .
I ask Commissioner Monti the other day what happen if he prove to be wrong and there be an effective renationalisation .
Mr von Wogau say we can look to the European Court .
well , we in Britain be look to the European Court at the moment .
we find that the European Court be not able to provide u with interim measure in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment , in which we have the support of the Commission .
unless anybody think that this be merely a nationalistic point , in the Factortame case , in which the British Government be the defendant , it take ten year for the European Court to give a ruling .
so , judicially , something need to be do .
I ask the Commission what can be do to speed up implementation in this particular area .
in relation to legal certainty , I endorse the point make by Mrs Thyssen .
it be important that business have legal certainty .
I mention this again to Commissioner Monti recently .
he say we must not always be carry along by lawyer .
I must declare an interest a a lawyer but also a a former competition minister in the United Kingdom .
we all have , a it be , our history to live with , but it be important that business have legal certainty .
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis have be undertake of the implication of this change for business : a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that be now become so much more European policy .
I know there have be an analysis of the implication for the Commission of the change .
we have be tell how , currently , people & apos ; s time be be waste and that the change , therefore , could be beneficial .
but I really feel that , in the circumstance , we want to know what the implication would be for business .
finally , we , a British Conservatives , be look for a change in direction , towards the development of an independent competition authority .
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti have to say about that .
Mr President , the European Union & apos ; s competition policy have be of central importance since European integration begin .
it be an integral part of the tension , inherent in the very concept of European integration , between solidarity and cooperation between Member States , with a view to create a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy , and competition , which should provide incentive to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union a an entity .
it be therefore with some justification that competition policy be one of the most important policy .
we can be proud of a European competition culture , for it be this that will make the social market economy a reality .
we can be proud of monopoly and merger supervision .
however , we must be vigilant in the face of global operator , against whom nation-states be no longer able to impose limit .
that be why we should bear in mind what be say by the French writer Vivienne Forestier , who describe the state of the world in term of the economy & apos ; s reign of terror .
society be surrender itself to the economy .
that be precisely what we do not want in the European Union .
we be aware that in this age of strategic alliance and millennium merger - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion be pay out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practice be be hold in check , not just by our own rule but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan , or others , until we get the international competition law we so badly need .
European competition policy , a we very often forget , be not just important for fair competition a such , but also for price , growth and employment , and hence for the public .
in common with the other Members , I call for Parliament to have codecision right where competition law be concern .
it be essential that this long overdue step be take .
it be also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection .
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti want to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament , a he do in the dialogue with non-governmental organisation , consumer protection association and the public .
greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decision relate to competition policy .
then it be possible to understand that , for example , lower electricity and telecommunication price be due to European competition policy , and Brussels should not be pillory when aid decision be take which be , of course , bound to cause problem at a particular moment in time or in a local context .
it be particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rule in view of EU enlargement .
emphasis must also be place on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report make this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the task of the public sector and ownership structure on an independent basis .
at the same time , it must be make clear that aid can serve a useful purpose , with a view to offset the deficiency of the market and further Community objective .
a word on the White Paper : the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represent a change of direction in monopoly policy .
I be oppose to this , unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group , because I believe that , in competition policy term , the directly applicable exception system be in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain condition be meet , and I believe there be a threat of renationalisation .
the system currently in force creates transparency , affords enterprise legal certainty and have , without a shadow of a doubt , lead to discipline and act a a deterrent on account of the notification requirement .
the problem of overwork highlight by the Commission be not a sufficient reason for make radical change to the legal system .
indeed , it be debatable whether this could be carry through at all without amend the Treaty .
Mr President , I be very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mention the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker have do so .
the advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleash enormous competitive force within European business which be be meet by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportion .
for example , the figure for last year now show that the total value of merger in the European area be EUR 1.4 trillion , which be seven time the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990 .
this pose enormous challenge for competition policy , which I hope it will be able to meet because , for certain , many of those merger be go to be design to protect profit margin of the business from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those business able to operate on a bigger scale .
Commissioner Monti and his colleague have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worry in the ELDR Group be that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of merger or the monitoring of restrictive practice .
delegation to national authority be all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau say in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authority to ensure that there be no slippage in the European element , and , particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure u that there would be random check on that .
Mr President , in the limited time I have , I would like to express my support for the work carry out by all the rapporteur and my agreement with many of the thing which have be say here , in particular by Mr Jonckheer , who criticise the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid .
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis have be put on the implementation of Article 82 , especially when we be witness abusive conduct in a context of market concentration .
a a Member for the Basque Country , I would like to express my total support for the implementation measure for fair competition in the market .
I say this in case there be any doubt about the criticism which we have direct at the Commission in general , and Mr Monti , in particular , for it persecution of the incentive to Basque company and the fact that it consider them to be state aid .
Mr President , Commissioner , competition be exactly what we need .
in other word , we must succeed in link the competition criterion that be necessary to the economy with those relate to managerial economics .
I often have the impression , unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness be prize above all else and competitiveness relate to managerial economics be disregard , that very often the reverse be the case ; society think almost exclusively in term of managerial economics .
I say that a an entrepreneur who have a vested interest in this .
but a system can not function in this way : it will only work if the two aspect go hand in hand .
I will give you an example : the European Union be right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg , although out of 5 000 job only 700 remain .
but these be competitive job , for this steelworks be now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany .
anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle , by demand the return of the aid that be grant at the time , would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region & apos ; s employer that small and medium-sized enterprise be , of course , dependent on too .
it go without say that that be not what the European Union & apos ; s competition policy be design to achieve .
if we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirement of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics .
indeed that be the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed region that will protect people & apos ; s social welfare and boost purchasing power .
to that end , we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy a oppose to one focus heavily on supply .
Mr President , ever since I be elect to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witness a report which have such anti-Irish sentiment and overtone a the Jonckheer report which we be debate today .
I would like to quote verbatim from the report : & quot ; state aid per caput be highest in Italy , Germany and Ireland.Ireland clearly be in the lead when national and Community regional and social fund be put together . & quot ;
I believe that the rapporteur be simply play with figure .
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social fund into this mathematical equation .
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union have agree to the new regional aid guideline for the period 2000 plus.This be merely an extension of the policy objective to complete the internal market within Europe .
regional disparity must be overcome if the internal market be to succeed and prosper .
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40 % and a top-up of 15 % for SMEs for fix investment will be permit for company set up in Objective 1 region in Europe post-2000 .
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish company or foreign company in Ireland still have to cross two sea mass to reach the mainland European marketplace .
no other Member State be at such a disadvantage .
Mr President , the monopoly & apos ; ban be the key element of function competition order in Europe .
the Commission deem the practical administration relate to the monitoring of the monopoly & apos ; ban to be unsatisfactory , something I would wholeheartedly agree with .
but opinion differs a to the solution .
the Commission & apos ; s proposal do not formally deviate from the monopoly ban but the upshot of this proposal be a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation .
in other word , we be make the transition from the principle of ban to that of misuse .
both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system .
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to change the law .
we would be change the law to make it executable again , which be something I consider to be unacceptable .
the Commission be give up it monopoly on exemption .
competition restriction be to be automatically exempt against the background of this planned system of legal exemption , insofar a the provision of Article 81 ( 3 ) of the Treaty on European Union allow .
the requirement to lodge application in Brussels will be drop ; in other word , the Commission will be completely in the dark in future .
this be unacceptable to my mind .
the Commission & apos ; s programme be to be supplement by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authority and Member States & apos ; court .
but if this take place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here be a patchwork quilt of competition policy .
this be unacceptable in my view .
it would weaken a key element of European policy .
the change of system in European monopoly law that the European Commission be contemplate be high risk a far a competition policy be concern .
there be enough other option in the present system to safeguard open market and free competition .
in any case , the Commission & apos ; s proposal refers back to old proposal that be put forward a long ago a the fifty and sixty .
there be no majority for this at the time .
since France lay a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time , it be damage by concession in agricultural policy .
forty year on , this proposal have again be place on the table and I be certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopoly , to the detriment of Europe & apos ; s consumer .
I consider this to be unacceptable .
Mr President , in this important debate on competition , I be speak this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen & apos ; s document on the Steel Aid Code .
a the Court of Justice recognise in 1996 , the steel industry be particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbance .
indeed , several year ago , this be the conclusion of a report that I compile on the strength and weakness of the European steel sector .
this be why it be justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensure the survival of successful business , even if this be in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty .
this indeed , be the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code , but at the same time it be important to avoid any infringement of the condition of competition and any serious disturbance of the market , hence the importance of regulate such aid .
it be therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development , environmental protection and case of company closure .
in the same category of idea , it be essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid grant to their steel company .
the Commission suggest shorter deadline .
I agree with this request .
like the rapporteur , while I be pleased with the Commission report , nonetheless I deplore the fact that it do not cover all aspect of the aid .
although the Steel Aid Code be express in a very clear way , the Commission have authorise grant steel company aid which be not cover by the category stipulate by the Code .
in the interest of equality , either the Code must be apply or it must be modify .
finally , and in conclusion , Mr President , with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty , the regulation will have to be review since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002 , and in that case I be in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area .
we therefore await , and I await , the European Commission & apos ; s proposal on this matter .
Mr President , I be also go to refer to the report by Mr Langen , which concern aid to the steel industry .
I agree with the rapporteur on two issue .
firstly , I agree on the need to guarantee equal condition for aid to all Member States and , secondly , on the need for transparency with regard to this aid .
we agree with the rapporteur regard his criticism of the fact that , despite the rule lay down in the sixth Steel Aid Code , the Commission have frequently authorise aid to company which do not correspond to the category in that Code .
however , the thing that worry u most , Mr President , be the decrease in price , by 30 % , owe to import .
the reason for this decrease be unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan , in the case of steel , a a result of their different working condition and condition govern aid .
order in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also speak about this a while ago - have decrease drastically , result in a loss of job .
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now have very serious problem : Asturias .
with global market , we need global employment law and global subsidy .
I know this be difficult to achieve now , but if we do not achieve fair employment law for all worker , here and elsewhere , and we do not secure equitable subsidy for all country , here and elsewhere , it will be difficult to preserve job in Europe and outside it .
Mr President , Commissioner , Director-General , I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report : I welcome the Commission & apos ; s open-minded endeavour to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rule , and to propose practical reform measure .
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau , who take up the theme but also make quite plain his demand for clarification , indicate the accompany measure that need to be take , and pull no punch when it come to the problem currently under discussion .
the White Paper and the report be contribution make at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection , discussion , and reform which have yet to be conclude because there be still a few question pose by ourselves , the judiciary , the Member States , and above all the SMEs concern , that need to be clarify .
competition policy must continue to be accord central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe a a business location in a global economy .
however , it must be & quot ; europeanise & quot ; take into account the principle of subsidiarity .
I also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility be to fall to the individual , without the Commission give up any of it responsibility .
I be in suspense a to how the discussion , which be broadly base , will be incorporate in the first legislative proposal .
the Commission report confirm that , with the exception of Germany , state aid to business be increase .
the Commission find this worry only from the point of view of the condition of competition .
a far a we be concerned , we look at thing from the point of view of the interest of the working class .
society gain nothing from these massive transfer of public fund to private business .
take , for example , the car manufacturing sector , where subsidy and state aid of various sort have increase by 24 % during the reference period .
with what aim ?
not to save job .
all these firm have go ahead with job cut and even redundancy .
not to improve work condition , for in increase production with fewer worker , work condition be make worse .
do these firm need state aid to survive ?
no , car manufacturer have be make colossal profit for year .
state aid be not only counterproductive because , a the Jonckheer report acknowledges , it give rise to subsidy hunt with firm relocate from one country to another , but it be unacceptable because it allocate public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholder .
it be because the richest people be be favour everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection be be reduce , public service be be abandon , hospital be be close .
in vote against the Jonckheer report , I wish to assert the need for another policy , to wit , cease all aid to private firm and utilise the money thereby save to develop public service and recruit staff .
Mr President , today & apos ; s debate be extremely important because the principle of competition have probably be the cornerstone of the internal market .
in accordance with the principle of competition , the legislation have implement Articles 85 to 94 , competition policy in the strict sense , and the revision of all state aid and tax provision which may affect competition .
firstly , fiscal provision of an indirect nature and recently , thanks to Commissioner Monti , there have be direct provision , the code of good conduct in particular .
this have work fairly well , but , a in the famous film Casablanca & apos ; time go by & apos ; and we must adapt the legislation we have be apply until now to the new circumstance .
in this respect I have observe a significant consensus in all the intervention .
firstly , it be necessary , in draw up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rule .
it be probably horrendous , especially in this particular raft of legislation , that there be confused rule , regulatory vacuum and rule that only lay down undefined legal concept .
this be all the worse - a be the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implement the legislation lie with national authority .
thirdly , it seem to me important that the Commission should play a role in resist the temptation to create independent agency which would distort the very essence of the Commission , in order to guarantee uniform application by international body .
fourthly , and lastly - and this have already be mention - the international legal order have change .
we have see this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we be now see it in the bilateral conference with different region or country of the world .
the principle of competition must now be universal in it application .
Mr President , Commissioner Monti , there be much that be good in Mr Jonckheer & apos ; s report on state aid for manufacture industry and certain other sector .
first of all the report reveal Parliament & apos ; s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market function flawlessly .
many of the report & apos ; s conclusion , however , be cause for concern , at least for our group .
for example , the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculate on a per caput basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveal the need for survey such a this .
aid that be base on the self-seeking ambition of a nation give company unfair advantage , thus distort competition and lead to an ineffective , uneconomic division of Europe & apos ; s meagre resource .
the form the aid take be important .
form of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary be to be support .
for example , state guarantee , on which the Commission have just publicise it position , must naturally be consider state aid , but they be , in my opinion , a better option than grant aid directly to company .
the report on competition policy further stress the Commission & apos ; s confidence in hard and fast rule instead of put the emphasis on economic argument regard efficiency , which affect competitiveness .
the European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desire if we do not show we trust in the market .
if competition policy be to be make subordinate to the aim of social and environmental policy , real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream .
competition policy have to be see a part of the whole of the economy and it must be assess with reference to trade policy and non-material right : we should not just be emphasise it social dimension .
the aim of social policy can be best realise through stronger economic growth , not by make compromise with regard to decision on competition policy .
Mr Rapkay & apos ; s report also emphasise the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law .
in my opinion , it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regard certain basic principle of competition law .
aim instead at harmonise minimum standard will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator , which will water down all the aim of competition policy .
Mr President , Mr Monti , the reform of competition rule call for a commitment by the European Union , not only in the light and a a consequence of change which have take place through the year , but also with a forward-looking view to the Union & apos ; s enlargement .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr von Wogau , for his commitment and I welcome his thought .
moreover , I would like to say that I appreciate the remark and observation that Professor Tesauro , Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority , send me , and which I be sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration .
our real concern be undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market , and , above all , to achieve consistency between the different national markets.As thing stand , there be considerable difference between them which come to the fore if we compare the English , Italian and French market .
there be a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which be not find in the English market and be only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy .
another issue concern the economy of country involve in enlargement , which may run the risk of remain assisted economy for ever more if provision be not make for gradual adjustment .
in my opinion , we should also create a threshold below which two significant component which characterise our economic structure should be place : small and medium-sized business , which bind the European economy together , and social protection , which Europe have always guarantee to the weakest part of the economy .
safeguard the social function of the market be what make the difference between free trade , pure and simple , and a system for improve people & apos ; s quality of life .
a point to consider regard the new rule concern the economy of the outermost region and island , all of which must be protect .
we ought therefore to consider create two focal point of an external market by instigate profitable relation with Russia and the Mediterranean country , precisely so that their economy become le peripheral .
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rule will reflect a many aspect of economic policy a possible and that their social function will be guarantee .
Mr President , competition be at the heart of the European internal market policy and be also it drive force .
a free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition , mark by clear , uniform rule .
in his report , Karl von Wogau manage to capture this very well .
but Europe be change .
the economy be grow , we be enlarge to 25-30 Member States .
the European Commission will become overburdened if it pursue it current policy .
it be therefore necessary to modernise competition policy .
this be not in question .
have say this , I still have concern about the propose decentralisation .
how will the Commission , a keeper of the Treaties , guarantee that decision be take uniformly in matter of competition in London , Palermo , Helsinki and , soon , Budapest and Ankara ?
this be necessary if legal inequality be to be prevent , and issue of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgement be give .
it be not enough to say that , in the Member States , there be already 40 year & apos ; worth of experience .
in the Netherlands , the competition authority be still in it infancy .
this country have a very small market which , unfortunately , be often at the same time define a the relevant market.This in contrast to Germany , where a very experienced Kartellamt be exercise it power within a gigantic market .
the European Commission & apos ; s belief that , in all quarter of the Union , legislation will , almost a a matter of course , be interpret in the same way , be what , within catholic circle , we term & quot ; foolhardy , & quot ; and this be not allow .
Uniformity need to be work on .
think of specialist , national court with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court .
this special court in Luxembourg be necessary in order to build up broad expertise .
moreover , due to the immense economic and social interest involve , we can not afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounce two year after the event , a be now quite normal .
what be the Commissioner & apos ; s opinion of this ?
I would like to finish off by make an important point for small and medium-sized business .
in order to grant small and medium-sized company greater security , the European Commission itself need to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized business so that , alongside vertical exemption , horizontal exemption will also be possible .
through cooperation , small , independent firm must be able to stand up to the large chain .
it can not be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small business .
moreover , regard these small business , we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning build in , the yellow card , instead of an immediate red card , which will be a large fine and will threaten the company & apos ; s very existence .
Mr President , be the last to speak give me the privilege , Commissioner , of tell you that the majority of this House support your initiative and have express a total , and , I believe , justified , confidence in you at the helm of this boat.But we all want to be oarsman on it .
we all belong on the same boat and want to row with you .
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touch to this essential reform .
the many idea which have be express here could be put into three broad category .
firstly , there be the concern that some have express , in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath , President of the Committee on Economic Affairs , of whether this new system of legal exception be absolutely compatible with the Treaty .
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be address .
secondly , we have the issue of company & apos ; legal certainty .
it be true , Commissioner , that the Commission be not a machine for manufacture legal certainty .
we all agree on this .
but it be nonetheless true - and this have be repeat from all section of this House - that the European industrial fabric be compose of small and medium-sized business , and that the Commission often play the role of auctoritas , of legitimise the nature of the internal market .
on this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas say .
there have only be nine rejection .
but here I would like to call on my experience a a lawyer .
how often have a lawyer with two company and one project , in the face of a Commission guideline give ex ante , change that project in order for it to comply with the competition rule !
this be therefore an aspect to be consider .
thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law .
in this respect , the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen can not be improve upon .
I believe that biodiversity be good , a be cultural diversity , but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market , that be to say , competition law .
here improvement should be make .
only in certain country , Germany for example , be there specialise jurisdiction .
perhaps this be a promising avenue to explore , but we must also explore others .
Commissioner , it be impossible to overstate the importance of this reform .
it transcend competition , it transcend the cohesion of the internal market.I believe that it profoundly affect the meaning of European integration , the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration .
therefore , Commissioner , we be rely on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touch to a reform which we be all hop for and which we believe will lead u to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest show in competition-related subject .
in my opinion , Mr President , this joint debate fully bear this out .
we have hear some very thorough observation which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and be important for the institutional order .
our common aim be to reform and strengthen competition policy , a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction .
the guide thread run through all the aspect of the reform of competition policy , which we shall have the opportunity to address together , aim to ensure more effective protection of competition , reduce the bureaucratic burden weigh down business and take decision-making process closer to the European people .
I , personally , would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examine the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report .
I would like to divide the consideration raise during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups.I do not consider these consideration to be criticism of the Commission , but , on the contrary , fundamental contribution , since justify concern have be express that we both want to overcome .
the group be : the efficiency of the rule , the risk of renationalisation , consistent application of the rule and legal certainty.I will take these very quickly one at a time .
efficiency : I be convince that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it .
the propose system will improve the protection of competition , primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate it action on the most serious restriction , also because it will involve national and competition authority to a greater degree in stamp out infringement , and lastly in that it will allow victim of infringement to have direct recourse to national judge , whose mission be to protect the right of individual .
the question of renationalisation : first of all , although it be not really necessary , I would like to point out and stress , several time if I may , that the White Paper do not affect merger or State aid in the slightest - we be not look for devolution in these area - but that , a far a Regulation 17 be concern , there be a risk of renationalisation .
of course we have ponder this issue , and we be still study it extremely carefully , and this be also thanks to the concern you have voice .
at the end of the day , I honestly do not believe that this fear be justified .
the Commission proposal accord the Commission a central role in establish guideline on competition policy .
the reform do not entail any reduction in the Commission & apos ; s activity , but require them to focus on the most important dossier .
the reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I be particularly take with this term , use by Mrs Randzio-Plath , and , moreover , I fully agree with it - of European competition culture .
so , the reform will lead to the various national competition culture be transplant and take root in the European competition culture - where today various small plant thrive , and they be certainly not all the same .
the fifteen set of national provision will gradually be abandon , permit greater use of Community law , which a higher number of protagonist will be able to apply .
allow me to emphasise that this be communitisation , not renationalisation , of competition law .
the question of consistent application : the risk of inconsistent application of competition rule must be bear in mind , but I do not believe that it should be exaggerate .
a with many other provision of the Treaty , Articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 have , after all , be apply for decade by national authority and judge , and I do not feel that this have create serious problem .
in a directly applicable exception system , consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rule .
the Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework , both through general provision and through it decision-making practice .
secondly , we will need to set efficient mechanism in place to prevent dispute , and the White Paper set out mechanism for information and consultation .
in this respect , I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne of monitor implementation .
this then be the idea of monitor implementation .
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up .
though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authority and so on , it be evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law be apply by national authority and court .
that be why the Commission want to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application .
this go at least some way towards alleviate your concern , Mrs Peijs .
concern Mr Evans & apos ; point regard the implication for business , it be important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conduct .
the purpose of publish the White Paper be , after all , to collect comment from business a well a from other source .
we have receive many excellent observation and contribution which give u the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business .
we will examine all that material carefully before make a legislative proposal for a new regulation .
there be one point about the impact for firm which be of great importance.This be raise by Mrs Thyssen , Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi : the issue of SMEs .
many speaker have underline this .
the Commission be pay particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs .
we be propose a system which considerably improve legal certainty for SMEs .
why ?
be this simply a political gesture ?
no .
in the system we propose reform our substantive rule in such a way that most SMEs will be cover by block exemption regulation , a in the field of vertical restraint .
most SMEs have in fact le than 30 % of the market share .
we have a de minimis notice which contain a declaration that since SMEs be not involve in market dominance they be not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81 ( 1 ) .
we be work on further block exemption and guideline which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs , and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs , first by eliminate the bureaucracy result from the present notification system , and secondly , by make Article 81 ( 3 ) directly applicable , which will benefit SMEs in particular .
the fourth group be legal certainty .
Mr Evans , legal certainty be , of course - and I be the first to acknowledge this - important for business , not just for the legal profession , although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe .
legal certainty be important for business : this be a subject , the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , emphasise in her last intervention - and I be very grateful to her for the way she always take the widest interest in subject regard the single market , include , in this case , competition .
( FR ) Mrs Thyssen also refer to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyer .
let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounce a ruling on this in 1982 , a you know better than I . This ruling remain valid and there be nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof .
the White Paper require only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined : the exchange of confidential information .
the guarantee which company must be give be currently under discussion .
( it ) I shall now quickly turn , Mr President , to Mr Rapkay & apos ; s report , and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement give to the Commission & apos ; s XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy .
we share the same basic view but the Rapkay report lay emphasis on several point that we shall need to consider very carefully .
I will mention only two , in order to be brief .
the first be greater transparency .
Parliament know how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy , a I do right from the moment I have my hearing , on 1 September , in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
Mr Jonckheer , I would like to thank you just a warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union .
I will not talk about codecision here , but this certainly do not mean I do not consider it important .
it have major institutional implication which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition ;
I be therefore not qualify to give an opinion , and this be obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference .
with regard to your suggestion , Mr Jonckheer , you already know that my staff , who , although short-handed a usual , be fortunately highly qualify , be work hard to produce the register of State aid and the State aid & apos ; scoreboard & apos ; .
I be await with great interest the result of the eighth survey , which , accord to the scheduled timeframe , should be be draw up by the staff now , in January , and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000 , to see whether the latest trend be confirm .
Mr Jonckheer , Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raise the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate country in term of competition in general and of State aid .
I can only say very briefly , that we be actively work with them on a practical level : they be make preparation , they now all have competition law and be set up the relevant authority .
I can also say , in respect of your concern on energy and especially on the environment - which , a you know , I share - that we be conclude the review of the organisation of environmental State aid .
in connection with the issue of State aid , I would also like to take up one of the point raise by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen , among others regard repayment of illegal aid .
in April 1999 , the Commission adopt new Rules of Procedure which introduce specific rule on repayment .
in the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rule .
finally , Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report , which , although gear more towards a specific sector , be a valuable contribution .
I would like to say that , a we know , the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry do not include individual decision make under the exception procedure , pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty , but address decision which be not cover by the code on aid for the steel sector .
in respect of future provision on aid for the steel sector , which will come into force in July 2002 , we will ensure that strict discipline continue to be apply , and the industry itself now agree on the need for this .
when we have finalise our proposal on the new rule and decide on the most suitable legal form , I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you .
so , Mr President , I will walk away from this debate , for which I be very grateful to Parliament , in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament & apos ; s intellectual and political support , which appear to come from all side of the House , for competition policy , it basic appreciation for the work the Commission be carry out and it confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future .
I be especially grateful for all of this .
we will continue the interinstitutional dialogue open with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs , and , at a more general level , with Parliament .
in this regard , I like your term , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi : we must all pull together , preferably in the same direction .
competition be not an end in itself , a Mr Rapkay rightly point out , but it play an extremely important role in European integration .
a Mr von Wogau say at the start of the debate , at the end of the day competition be not an abstract concept : it be in the public interest and form the basis of the social market economy .
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social , a well a economic , role in the European integration process , a it have do in the past .
thank you , Commissioner Monti .
the joint debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
protection under criminal law of the Union & apos ; s financial interest
the next item be the report ( A5-0002 / 2000 ) by Mrs Theato , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , contain Parliament & apos ; s recommendation to the Commission on introduce protection under criminal law of the Union & apos ; s financial interest .
Mr President , year after year we learn , mainly from the European Court of Auditors & apos ; test report , that money be lose to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanour range from wastage , mismanagement , and irregularity to suspect blatant fraud .
for some time now , these abuse have mean that Parliament have be call upon to initiate measure that should serve to protect the European taxpayer & apos ; s money , which , when all be say and do , be what sustain the Union & apos ; s budget .
particular attention in this respect should be give to combat fraud , to detect it , punish those guilty of it and prevent it from happen .
create UCLAF by mean of the Task Force and set up the anti-fraud office OLAF be important step , a be the regulation on protect the financial interest of the Community and on local monitoring .
the Union can only impose sanction in the field pertain to administrative law when case be expose .
so far , effort on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtain money to be return only have limit success .
it be for the Member States to undertake criminal measure .
since there be often overlap between the two legal angle and cross-border violation against the Union budget be on the increase - they be also commit by those involve in organised crime - it be unclear a to where the responsibility lie amongst the Member States .
then there be difference between the national legal requirement of the individual Member States , together with protract or even unfulfilled request for mutual assistance in law enforcement .
what be more , the agreement on the protection of financial interest and the two subsequent protocol sign by the European Council in 1995 do nothing to change this .
for it to enter into force , it must be ratify by all 15 Member States .
after five year only four have do so .
this state of deadlock , which threaten to undermine the credibility of the Union , have inspire Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor & apos ; s Office .
there be no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority , rather the aim be to equip the Union with specific instrument for the protection of it financial interest , that be whilst uphold the principle of subsidiarity .
we be give new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposal that will enable this goal to be realise .
the concern of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , a articulate in it position , together with those of the Committee on Citizens & apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , will also be take full account of in this process .
we would like to make two recommendation arise from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard it operational and legal efficiency , transparency , and the protection of the right of individual .
in addition , we need - and this be my first recommendation - a legislative act that include those offence which be to the detriment of the Union & apos ; s financial interest , and in which main principle be firmly establish .
I support the propose deadline for the Commission be 30 September in a propose amendment .
the second recommendation relate to criminal proceeding .
the Commission ought - and I have also amend this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which have institutional link with the Commission , for coordinate and supervise the legal investigative body OLAF .
the exist monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency .
the proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define it task , which be confine to inquiry and criminal prosecution undertake by OLAF into activity which be to the detriment of the Union & apos ; s financial interest , and to OLAF & apos ; s relationship with the national authority .
there be no question of this influence the administration of justice in the Member States .
the Court of Justice be to monitor the legality of the legislative act .
in addition , we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor & apos ; s Office for the protection of the financial interest of the Union , where possible on the basis of the now widely recognise study compile by well-known expert , the so-called corpus juris , and of the feasibility study that have subsequently appear .
further support for this proposal be also to be find in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men .
the Commission , Mr Barnier , Mr Vitorino and several Member States be equally receptive to the idea .
I call upon you , lady and gentleman , to vote in favour of this report , which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopt with a large majority .
we can set another example here , to the effect that Parliament be take action to prevent mismanagement and in particular , fraud , and to mete out punishment where necessary .
Mr President , I be happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato .
I believe that this be a report for which cooperation between committee have work very well , and the result , which we have receive today , be moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area.This moderation and thoughtfulness be particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280 ( 4 ) .
if we have to give a prize for the article which be most difficult to understand , least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought .
the Treaty be a collection of complex articles.However , this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize .
at the same time , it be an especially delicate issue because it deal with the protection of the Community & apos ; s financial interest , a Mrs Theato have explain very well .
we be all aware - and this Parliament have be the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interest of the Community.But be careful .
the conclusion of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly .
therefore , in my capacity a president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , and , of course , a an MEP , I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implement by the Commission .
Mr President , this , a Mrs Theato say , be a critical report .
it be a report that have be propose by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it be an own-initiative report .
one of the reason why we be very keen to bring this forward be because , whether we like it or not , the European Union have a reputation for fraud and mismanagement.It be sometimes exaggerated but there it be .
we need to do something about it .
some of the measure we have put in place in the past have not be honour by some of the Member States - and let u not forget that the Member States be responsible for implement about 80 % of the EU budget .
a lot of them have not sign up to or not ratify the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests , and therefore it be clear that something more radical need to be do .
we need to take this responsibility seriously .
we need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union .
the question be : who prosecute ?
that be where we really get into difficulty .
whose responsibility be it when you be deal with a body that cross so many frontier ?
we need also to be sensitive to the concern of Member States .
the proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service be a very sensitive one .
we be all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority take precedence over the national judicial authority be a step too far for some people .
but the discussion need to begin and we be therefore call on the IGC to start discussion .
of most importance to Parliament , a the guardian of the budget of the European Union , be how to deal with people who work within the European Union institution .
at a time when we be look at the whole reform process it be critical that we send the right signal .
people need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecute , and that be not the case at the moment .
the whole question a to whether we have the legal authority to do this have be outline by Mrs Palacio .
I should like to make clear that my group be go to propose an amendment delete the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question .
we be aware that it be a delicate debate .
we know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all party .
can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here , no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor .
but there be a definite commitment to change the status quo which be totally unacceptable .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulate Mrs Theato on her report .
I think it be a first-class report which will , for the most part , be support by my group .
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have prefer to take it a little further at this stage .
judge from the discussion hold over the past five or six month , this could well be the case .
we all know that , in 1995 , it be agree that the Union & apos ; s financial interest should be give better protection under criminal law .
but the Member States fail to cooperate .
this be just a political fact about which little can be do at present , I think .
it be now possible , on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty , that the Commission will take new initiative , and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity .
unlike the previous speaker , who have now disappear , my group be strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor .
my colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga , will undoubtedly take this point further because he have already publish a report on the same subject matter .
I think what we need be , at European level , to come up with exact definition of fraud and irregularity a quickly a possible .
I myself have be involve in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic .
one of the major problem in this area be that if you do something wrong , especially when it come to revenue of the European Union , then this will be term an irregularity in one country and a crime in another .
this , I think , be no longer permissible , certainly not at the moment .
I would like to make one general point on politics.Whatever we may say about the European election , the low turnout be a fact .
we can improve on this by punish crime in Europe quickly , and this must be do at European level .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur .
Mrs Theato & apos ; s report may help to restore confidence in European institution .
I believe that be something we be all desperately in need of , bear in mind the result of the last European election and of the level of turnout .
yet , every year we have the same problem .
the Court of Auditors publish it report , which criticise the Member States on account of various incidence of fraud .
so far , however , the European institution have not have sufficient mean at their disposal to take vigorous action here , to ensure that implementation actually take place and that matter be remedied .
it be precisely this process that undermines confidence every year .
I believe that Mrs Theato & apos ; s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institution take step to ensure that European money be employ in a targeted manner and that no fraud be perpetrate here .
it be important that after the first step , which have already be take , i.e . form OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF , in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework .
we will need the European Public Prosecutor & apos ; s Office for this , which will see to it that there be clear legal guarantee , also for suspect .
have say all that , I must say that unfortunately , my group will not be vote for your report a a united front .
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people .
unfortunately , however , people still have too many misgiving to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity .
but I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato & apos ; s report receive more support .
Mr President , we be basically in favour of the resolution that have be table , even if we think that this can only be interpret a an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties , so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union & apos ; s financial interest can be guarantee .
the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor & apos ; s Office and the definition of offence common to all country of the Union be doubtless a good idea , but it be impossible to consider put this into practice without have first introduce a European legal system .
indeed , we be talk about criminal law , the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation be , and will be , fierce .
indeed , it be unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulation solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interest - without first have create a European legal system .
read the precise and comprehensive explanation in the Theato report make you realise just how many problem still need to be resolve and what these problem be .
in any case , this idea must be encourage , and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interest that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties .
on behalf of my group , but also personally , I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respect citizen & apos ; right and guarantee , which be to say a legal system that will raise guarantee to the acceptable level hitherto unseen in many States .
therefore , on behalf of my group , I would like to say that we support the Theato report ;
I nevertheless think that this be essentially a subject that should be include on the IGC agenda .
Mr President , Mrs Theato & apos ; s report on the protection of the European Union & apos ; s financial interest propose centralise criminal proceeding by initially create a European Public Prosecutor .
this proposal be radically oppose to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceeding that lie at the heart of the national legal system must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state .
but the idea of a European Public Prosecutor , on the other hand , aim in the long term to confine the national state to a subordinate role in these matter .
moreover , this proposal be liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reform .
accord to the Theato report , the European Public Prosecutor be need , in particular , in order to better support the inquiry of the anti-fraud office , OLAF .
at the same time , however , we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervise by a European Union court .
in this way , a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one , and a medium-sized one may hide a large one .
not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one , a the very next thing we will see be a proposal for a European criminal law and then , why not a European Minister of Justice , supervise by an extension of the power of the European Parliament ?
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we be in danger of upset if we put forward this type of reform , which appear to be quite specific .
in the final analysis , we feel that proposal such a the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form , organise around a superstate .
the Union for a Europe of Nations Group , on the other hand , wish to see a polycentric Europe with nation link in a network .
and such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authority , for example , and the creation , if necessary , of national team specialise in offence involve Community finance .
so the legal framework , Mr President , be already in place .
it be fine , in principle .
it need only be fine-tuned .
Mr President , Mrs Theato be propose institutional revolution for a twofold reason .
public opinion , although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousand of mad cow , be now suppose to be worry about the fraud endanger financial interest and these two reason be suppose to justify a twofold solution : a European criminal code with crime against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General .
Mrs Theato probably forget to include a European prison now that we have the FBI , the European police , in the form of OLAF .
all this would be establish by two regulation , one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code.The regulation would be adopt pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty , i.e . base on secondary law , whose characteristic feature be that it make any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible .
and indeed there be a twofold shift .
firstly , the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift , a single market , a single VAT , a single diplomatic service , a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor .
all this to combat fraud worth le than EUR 1 billion , while disregard the ten of billion of euro lose due to the Generalised System of Preferences , free trade area , custom present to Chiquita and the billion lose to the fourth resource , GDP , a a result of the budgetary rationing pact .
next we have the Puritan shift : the Teutonic Europe of the North , the Europe of the Lutherans , Calvinists and Quakers , wish to inflict it moral order on u .
basically , the more we lose our grip on moral , the more we tighten our grip on our wallet .
Mr President , it be essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interest of the European Union , more so these day than there use to be .
the fraud and corruption scandal of the past have have a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe & apos ; s citizen .
the credibility of the effort we make here in Parliament to employ our finance properly stand and fall with the effort we make to deal with such scandal and prevent them from arise in the future .
this do not just mean administrative change but also structural change ; in other word we must create instrument which be actually capable of afford protection under criminal law .
the Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discuss this .
now it be , of course , possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceeding law be intrinsically matter pertain to the law of the Member States and it be quite unthinkable that they should be govern by the principle of subsidiarity .
there be no doubt that I myself be one of the advocate of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competence at European level .
when it come to the demand make on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda , it be the call for there to be clear delimitation of competence that should take centre stage .
now that be not a contradiction , since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceeding law , a detail in Recommendations I and II of the report , be actually about take action in the EU & apos ; s own interest , which , a far a that go , do not damage the legal interest of the Member States ; on the contrary , it protect them , at least indirectly .
the compatibility with the various national system of law , a confirm by expert , show that criminal law be another area where Europe have a great deal in common , for example where the significance of the offence we have be discuss here be concern .
take these aspect into account , I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind , a propose , and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF .
Mr President , will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involve EU fund ?
I do not believe so .
on the other hand , we can go a long way use the exist tool .
an alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust , a propose at the last Summit .
in the way it be structure , Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigation into crime .
it be just such practical cooperation there be a need for .
OLAF , Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be use fully and , when the Fraud Convention from 1995 be at long last ratify in the Member States , we can also achieve a lot with this .
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it be quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratify this Agreement .
it be simply too bad , and I can well understand why people be become impatient and demand that we have a common European Public Prosecutor & apos ; s Office instead .
however , it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office .
it be , after all , only the most serious crime which would have consequence under criminal law.Ninety per cent of case would be disciplinary matter concern negligence or incompetence .
instead , there be a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily .
we should alter the staff regulation and disciplinary procedure and , especially , change our practice .
at the moment , Article 52 of the staff regulation concern dismissal on the ground of gross negligence be never use .
should we not make a point of clean up our own act and put our own house in order before we plunge into construct grand new institution !
Mr President , we all want to do something about combat European fraud .
but the question be now : be the European Union do anything about it a well ?
the answer to this be that we know very little about this .
the Tampere Summit be about combat crime .
everyone be supposedly pleased about it but , in reality , we have make little progress .
there be no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States , a be state before , have not ratify the treaty text submit .
so a great deal have to be do in this area .
and what exactly should be do ?
two thing , and Mrs Theato & apos ; s report clearly spell these out .
firstly , the same penalty clause regard European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union .
so , unification in this small area .
secondly , we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor & apos ; s Office with two task , firstly to assist the national public prosecutor , help bring criminal proceeding in European fraud case and , secondly , to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these be two criminal investigation service which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision .
the European Public Prosecutor & apos ; s Office be nothing to be afraid of .
I feel there be a lot of scaremongering go on .
it be , in fact , something very positive .
just like Europol.Europol , involve police cooperation , do not rank above the national police force , but be there for the purpose of exchange information between police force .
this be exactly the task which a small , limited , European Public Prosecutor & apos ; s Office should carry out , not just at the criminal investigation stage , but also at the prosecution stage .
Parliament support this .
the Committee of Wise Men support this .
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same .
Mr President , I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris .
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan say on this issue .
corpus juris be something that be set up without any kind of public debate or public participation .
the idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with override jurisdiction throughout EU territory would have a major impact on the traditional system both in Ireland and the UK .
the idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor be something which Member States have a right to be inform about .
indeed when the plan be initially draw up they say it would be restrict to case of fraud against the EU budget .
but when corpus juris be actually launch in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurist , with no medium invite - the President of the European Parliament at the time , Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado , say that he consider it embryonic and that the intention be to extend EU competence in criminal matter to all area of criminal activity .
we need a public debate on this .
we need the Member States and the citizen in the Member States to be properly inform .
the issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK need to be address .
there need to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there have be to date .
it be unacceptable that something like this have be foist on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate .
Mr President , on behalf of the Italian Radical Members , I abstain on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control , because I share the concern that have be voice , in such an authoritative way , by the representative of another legal culture which be certainly important : common law .
with this text we be undoubtedly force the issue , since we believe that there be point that must be resolve and it be important for Community fraud to be curb , to be crush .
nevertheless , the way in which our committee intend to see this text through , with the drive and stubborn desire of it Chair , Mrs Theato , will not be without it critic .
another major criticism of the text concern secondary law .
Article 280 of the Treaty allow the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instrument to curb fraud .
nevertheless , we be left feel slightly perplex that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality , without immediately plan how to deal with the repercussion of this.That be to say , they be neglect the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system .
we want to express our perplexity a regard these point by abstain in committee .
Mr President , we need to speak our mind on this subject in the European Parliament , during the plenary sitting and in the committee , even if it be obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture , the legal culture and the place where institutional issue be address .
we find ourselves deal with some very serious event , which in the past seem to be the norm .
today , something have change , at least in term of mechanism , and especially a regard monitoring , but we be still not satisfied , particularly if debate be hold in competent forum that go a far a to discuss a European Public Prosecutor , crime , fraud , the misappropriation of fund and the disclosure of confidential information pertain to one & apos ; s office at European level .
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community & apos ; s interest , it image and it relationship with taxpayer , who be an indispensable and essential part of Community life .
for this reason , it be right to look at the issue of safeguard common interest , and to establish better link with legal system within the individual States .
in this respect , we be face with the most sensitive issue : what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relation with the individual national community and their domestic legal system ?
this issue need to be explore further in both cultural and practical term .
today , we run the risk of add a new institution to the already numerous and varied institution which exist within each country .
Mr President , I would very much just like to add to two particular point .
firstly , I would not wish to take up the philosophical issue of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States , although I be very much in favour of have such a debate , for my regular viewing of British television programme have show me what the national politician be conjure up there in the way of threat pose by the continent to the home-grown legal system .
sometimes it be worthy of satire and merit discussion , but I digress .
the point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato & apos ; s report .
I believe that a far a the judicial difficulty be concerned that we be face here - and the European Union evidently have only very limited room for manoeuvre when it come to make these offence litigable a European criminal offence - we have become embroil in legality .
I be refer to Recommendations 1 and 2 .
after all , there be no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor , rather , for legal reason it have now become an independent , European authority , or & quot ; body & quot ; to quote Mrs Theato .
we obviously have difficulty there with regard to the legal basis .
we also face difficulty with regard to offence .
nothing have change there .
a have always be the case , there be offence that transcend European offence , a it be , or at least there be the potential for them to do so , and these might include money-laundering , receive steal good , and form a criminal organisation .
a far a that be concern , I believe there be judicial uncertainty that need to be overcome .
what Parliament need to do a a matter of urgency though - and this be why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendation - be to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affair .
Mr President , for year , Parliament have call for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union & apos ; s financial interest .
frustration inevitably set in when we see the weakness of the Convention ( and of the protocol relate to this protection ) which , five year after be sign , have still not be ratify and have still not come into force .
on the other hand , more pro-active attempt , such a OLAF , which be currently operate , have not allay legitimate concern about the system of guarantee for individual right .
the proposal in Mrs Theato & apos ; s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection , under criminal law , of our financial interest , which would criminalise certain activity , specifically fraud against the Community budget.These proposal represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community .
at the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigation by OLAF , without harm the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice .
finally , follow on from what be agree in Tampere , the report restate the need for a European Public Prosecutor.This issue have be bring once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino & apos ; s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in it agenda the creation of this new role , which everyone considers vital .
we should approve this report because it highlight the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institution , by protect the Union & apos ; s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which be capable of maintain the credibility of the Community & apos ; s economic life .
nevertheless , it raise some very basic question .
be there currently a sufficient legal basis for justify , in legal term , the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which , although it might be call subsidiary , will always clash with the practice , and in certain area , with the traditional , separate criminal law of the Member States ?
a there be doubt , would it not be more advisable , from a political point of view , to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda , and incorporate these proposal into the more general reform of the Union & apos ; s legal system along the line of what be be request for the European Public Prosecutor ?
surely these subject will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaty which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom , security and justice ?
Mr President , the EU be now expose to tough scrutiny .
confidence in the European Union have be seriously damage .
to remedy this , vigorous effort be require .
we therefore welcome increased resource for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicion more efficiently .
at the same time , we think it be obvious that those who commit crime against the EU must be able to be hold accountable in an effective way .
it be unfortunate that the convention for protect the Union & apos ; s financial interest have be put into effect in so few Member States .
we therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of table proposal entail the further development of the already existing legal framework .
on the other hand , I be not convinced that make the process more efficient in this way require common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime .
in the present situation , I be therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor , which it be scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty .
we have more confidence in Eurojust , where prosecutor from the individual nation cooperate .
the major problem be not that no measure be be take against crime commit against the Union but , rather , that these be commit so often and far too seldom discover .
the challenge for the Commission and for ourselves be , however , to find the right mix .
the mismanagement and example of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our end up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which , through an exaggerated supervision of detail , prevent the development of a modern administration .
we therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten & apos ; s report .
the main idea ought to be that each administration take responsibility for it own supervision .
our experience of modern administration tell u that openness , decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation be often a effective a detailed bureaucratic supervision .
the major challenge be , therefore , to create a modern and efficient administration without compromise on supervision and the rule of law .
this require staff training , more modern recruitment method and , above all , openness and public control .
be able to scrutinise the administration effectively be the best protection against irregularity .
Mr President , rapporteur , restore the confidence of the citizen in the work of the European institution and in European politics be one of the most important task we have before u .
the Commission have give it commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reform document this .
Parliament be commit to this task , which be something this report bear impressive witness to .
on behalf of the Commission I be able to congratulate the rapporteur on have again address the genuinely difficult question a to what we can do , in term of create legal base and effect institutional change , to step up the fight against fraud perpetrate against the European Union .
on ratify the Amsterdam Treaty , all Member States state that they want to accord combat fraud against the financial interest of the European Union the same priority a combat fraud to their own detriment .
yet a thing stand , only the first four Member States have ratify the agreement conclude in 1995 .
the Commission wholeheartedly agree with the rapporteur that this be an unacceptable situation
a legislative act , a directive , in which there be a standardised definition for the different type of fraud such a money-laundering or corruptibility , and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceeding be enshrine a a binding objective , may enable u to take a major step forward , and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste .
OLAF , the European anti-fraud office be one of the most important instrument the Commission have for fulfil it obligation to combat fraud .
accordingly , the Commission refuse to put up with the fact that both European bank , the ECB and the EIB , contest the right of OLAF to include these two institution in it investigation , cite their independent status .
this be why the Commission resolve on raise a complaint against these two bank at it last meeting , and I hope that Parliament approve this step .
the second recommendation in this report relate to assess the legitimacy of the investigative measure undertake by OLAF in the various European institution .
it be the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF , which be set up at the same time a OLAF , to safeguard the independence of OLAF , however it can not undertake the action mention in the report of monitor internal investigative activity conduct by OLAF .
I be fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point .
in other word , there be a loophole here which must be fill and I will examine the solution advocate in the report in the interest of move thing on .
there be one thing I would ask though : I believe we must prevent the debate on extend the legal basis for OLAF from lead to the misconception that OLAF do not now have enough authority .
no , there must be no undermining of OLAF & apos ; s authority , and neither do I think this be the rapporteur & apos ; s intention .
a such , I would ask you to give OLAF & apos ; s work your full support , also in it present form .
thank you , Commissioner Schreyer .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .

( Parliament approve the Commission proposal )
Heaton-Harris ( PPE-DE ) .
Mr President , on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure : namely Rules 133 ( 2 ) and 138 ( 4 ) .These be both about voting .
be it not the case that on vote other than roll-call vote , the vote should take place initially by show of hand and only then , if there be some doubt , should we utilise the electronic voting system ?
that be quite right , Mr Heaton-Harris.I put the matter to a vote by a show of hand because none of the group have request voting by roll call .
you know that voting by roll call or electronic check only take place if Members of the House request it .
in this particular case , I can assure you there be a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just vote on .
Mr President , I be not refer to that particular vote but to vote in general .
it be obvious that some president do not look at the hand , so to speak , but go straight to the electronic voting system .
I be wonder whether this be the correct procedure .
I know it take longer , but should we not always have a show of hand first ?
Mr President , a far a the second reading be concern , the Commission can only accept one propose amendment put forward by Parliament .

explanation OF VOTE- Own resource
. ( FR ) The European Union be apparently finance through four own resource .
the European budget be effectively source from VAT and on the basis of GDP , especially now that the Community preference system have be abandon and the multiplication of free trade area have put pay to customs duty and the common agricultural levy , which have already be cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences .
since then , Community VAT fraud and distortion in the calculation of GDP , the taxable basis for the fourth resource , have have a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resource .
since then , of course , this Europe with pretension to federalism be now more than ever finance like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually be , but which it refuse to see itself a .
this can be clearly see in the regulation before u .
it show a concern with the accounting involve own resource , the process of make them available or with the monitoring of declared amount make available to the Commission .
furthermore , the new Advisory Committee that have be create be make up of representative of the taxpaying Member States .
this be a long way from offshoot such a the & quot ; Community criminal code & quot ; , the & quot ; European Public Prosecutor & quot ; or a European police force , with OLAF .
there be a yet no federal European tax .
all the same , a Europe with 25 member will be want a European tax on income , if not on profit , or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025 .
Koch Report ( A5-0105 / 1999 )
- ( FR ) It be with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety adviser for the transport of dangerous good .
in recent year , the transportation of dangerous good nationally and internationally have increase considerably , increase the risk of accident .
some of these risk be due to an inadequate awareness of the risk inherent in such transportation .
it therefore prove necessary , in the context of establish the internal market , to adopt some measure intend to ensure better risk prevention .
directive 96 / 35 / EC be a response to this requirement .
firm involve in the transport of dangerous good and in the loading and unloading operation relate to such transportation have be oblige , quite rightly , to comply with regulation regard risk prevention , whether road , rail or inland waterway transport be involve .
in order to facilitate achieve this objective , Directive 96 / 35 / EC provide for the appointment of safety adviser for dangerous good who would have appropriate professional training .
this professional training would be target at awareness of the term of the legislation , regulation and administrative condition applicable to such transport .
while this represent significant progress at the time , the lack of specific term govern the harmonisation of examination requirement prove to be a problem .
it therefore seem essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised , high-level training of safety adviser , but also in order to avoid any disparity between the cost of training , with a concomitant effect on competition between the firm of different Member Sates .
the Commission proposal seek to ensure that the training of safety adviser be standardise .
it outline the minimum content of examination and define the role of the authorise body a well a the requirement demand of the examine body .
Parliament vote in favour of this text .
it do , however , table a number of amendment , most of which be adopt in the Council & apos ; s common position , particularly regard the need to draw up a questionnaire and statement on the authorisation of some document in the context of the & apos ; specification of the examination arrangement propose by the examination body & apos ; .
in order to be realistic , I further support postpone the date for the application of these condition until three month after the directive itself come into force .
I shall conclude by emphasise that harmonise the professional qualification of adviser will contribute to improve the quality of the service in the interest of user , to minimise the risk of accident likely to cause damage to the environment a well a significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous good .
Koch Report ( A5-0104 / 1999 )
last October I express my view on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous good by rail .
the view I shall express today be not far remove from those I have then .
essentially , my opinion be a follow : I deplore the fact that , in a field a crucial a the transport of dangerous good , we keep put off the adoption of harmonised standard to the detriment of human being and the environment .
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous good by road come into force on 1 January 1997 .
this include a number of interim condition valid until 1 January 1999 .
this be the time when we should have express our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogation .
in line with the usual procedure , it be the European Committee for Standardisation ( CEN ) which put forward standard in this area , and they be then integrate in to the European Agreement concern the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road sign in Geneva in 1957 ( know generally a ADR ) , applicable throughout Europe , whose term and condition form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU .
the CEN have be unable to complete it work in the time allot .
consequently , the Commission proposal under discussion today be intend to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problem , rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangement , a should have be the case !
this be exactly what happen in the case of transport of such good by rail , except for the fact that a time limit have be decide .
right now we do not have the slightest idea a to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposal .
until then , there be really no point in Member States amend their national regulation .
the report also accept that some flexibility may be adopt , and grant States the option of adopt or apply alternative standard .
they may , therefore , continue to enforce their own standard regard certain type of pressure vessel use for transportation , where there be no applicable European standard .
they may also adopt alternative condition for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation .
in offer this explanation of my vote , therefore , I wish to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern .
Schroedter Report ( A5-0108 / 1999 )
Mr President , I want to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation follow on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development .
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparity in wealth which continue to exist between the different region in Europe .
not only the difference in income per caput but , above all , large disparity in employment continue to give cause for concern .
despite the fact that the Community , through the structural fund among others , inject considerable sum into combat the disparity between regional development opportunity in Europe , these disparity continue to exist .
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and , base on very strict evaluation , change it course and change it objective in such a way a to make it possible to combat the disparity in wealth and employment more effectively .
Mr President , in relation to the Schroedter report , I be aware , and have have it confirm to me by Mr Barnier , that the rule on additionality concern Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing region such a Wales or Scotland .
I regard that a a very unsatisfactory state of affair .
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time .
I want it to be clear that though I vote in favour of the report , I have this important reservation .
- The Schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnership with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000-2006 .
I believe that this be particularly important a EU Structural Funds be always spend in a manner which maximise the economic development of different region when local and regional authority be involve in the decision-making process for the spending of such fund .
a a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster , I have always support the need for the implementation of bottom-up scheme support by national EU fund .
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU government can not alone decide on specific spending priority .
I believe that local authority and group from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involve in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds .
for example , we have see the success of the Leader I and Leader II scheme in Ireland in term of the job which have be create through the administration of these programme in rural part of Ireland and within Europe .
the Leader III scheme be set to be implement some time later this year .
the Leader programme at it core affords an opportunity for public , private and voluntary group to pool their collective talent so a to create long-term and sustainable job in small and medium-sized enterprise in rural area .
this be a classic example of how the partnership concept operate and such scheme must be support in it broadest remit .
the European Peace and Reconciliation Fund have also be a success in create job in border county in Ireland .
once again , there be active participation from group from the private , public and voluntary sector which suggest how best particular funding can be spend so a to help different local job creation project within this region .
during the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006 , other EU initiative such a & quot ; Equal & quot ; and & quot ; Urban & quot ; will be operating .
these initiative must also involve the participation of local authority and local community in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spend .
the rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plan and programme .
they must promote a decentralised , efficient and comprehensive partnership base on the skill and commitment of all sector in regional and local authority .
this be very sensible because key economic and social difficulty in our country can not be overcome unless there be key integration between national , European and local funding .
.
( FR ) This report take u back to the question of why we even have a regional policy .
in order to reduce disparity between region , of course .
but more especially because , even though at first sight the European market guarantee u improve functioning of the economy , it may also be a source of inequality .
Jacques Delors be accustom to say that the market be short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparity .
it be precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lie behind the European social model , which we be all in favour of , and which give rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion .
this be a real political objective , alongside economic and monetary affair , draw up in collaboration with Member States , region and local community , with the Commission itself responsible for issue guideline in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objective require in the context of programming .
this be why I shall support this report , despite regret the fact that , for timetabling reason , the European Parliament be only consult at a very late date on the guideline intend to assist Member States , region and local community in the programming of Objectives 1 , 2 and 3 .
moreover , I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , add a whole raft of thought on key area such a combat social exclusion , support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy .
Mrs Schroedter & apos ; s report mark a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid .
it highlight the increase vital role of all the party involve , chiefly those involve at a local level , who be the only one able to define specific requirement and social problem , hence our determination to ensure that the partnership to be establish be true partnership , which be decentralise and involve all the agent concern .
this be the reason for the request which we be put forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States , which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid .
in order to do so , the monitoring committee must be open to include Members of the European Parliament , association and industrialist concern by the project and also civil society .
these guideline represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid .
amended again a such by the Schroedter report , they be a step in the right direction .
they also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006 , but that be another subject .
in the meantime , let u support this first step .
- This report call for drastic cut in the level of illegal state aid dish out by some Member States .
although I wholeheartedly support this aim , I would much rather see such aid eliminate altogether .
in my mind , illegal state aid amount to little more than state-sponsored social dumping .
we all oppose social dumping when perpetrate by fat cat industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrate by government .
if we be to have an effective single market that make European industry globally competitive and generate wealth and employment for all Europeans , then we must have a level playing field .
illegal state aid , by contrast , destroy competitive company and creates unemployment .
there be , of course , case when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example help company restructure .
in all such case , however , strict criterion must be meet and prior approval from the European Commission gain .
whether we be talk about beef to France or about backhander to industry , EU Member States must not be allow to flout the law .
I enthusiastically support the report & apos ; s proposal to publish a & quot ; scoreboard & quot ; show the amount of state aid per Member State .
country that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break it rule should be name and sham and their hypocrisy reveal .
Member States can not be allow to proclaim European solidarity in public while try to undermine the single market in private .
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that level of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be fall .
much remain to be do , however , and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in expose the subsidy junky of Europe .
( PT ) The Commission & apos ; s main instrument for overcome regional disparity be the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.It be therefore crucial that the European Parliament draft it broad indicative guideline without threaten the principle of subsidiarity , give that establish the development strategy for each country fall to the respective Member States .
unfortunately , the European Commission have already move ahead with it guideline and Parliament & apos ; s position on the programme for 2000-2006 do not carry much weight .
it be nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these fund to be the development of the country and region with the greatest problem and of the outermost region , of which the Portuguese region of the Azores and Madeira be examples.This must be do with the objective of achieve economic and social cohesion .
the truth be though , that the Commission & apos ; s guideline do not fully meet these objective .
in the first place , if administrative procedure be not simplify , it will be hard to attain Community objective on reform , with a view to greater efficiency and concentration .
in this respect , the Commission document have shortcoming , a it make no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedure and national legislation for the presentation and examination of project by the national authority , and for their funding , execution and monitoring .
SMEs , micro-enterprises and craft business in particular be still & quot ; weak operator & quot ; , give that it be precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraint impose by some Member States , include Italy , be major obstacle to access Structural Funds .
a considerable stumbling block be the fact that the region and other operator find it impossible and be incapable of make plan in time .
this be why the mid-term review , provide for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260 / 99 , will be of considerable importance .
in general , the current guideline can not be consider a clear or transparent .
they merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assess the progress make in relation to verifiable objective which be completely consonant with the strategy follow in Community policy , and they do not pay enough attention to the implication of enlargement , so much so that they do not contain specific provision or clarification a regard either regional and national authority , or candidate country .
that say , the differ approach adopt in the guideline , which be not gear to geographical objective , but rather to policy area , can be consider a positive .
while in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of intervention , we can not help wonder whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zone allows , in practice , a policy of integrated intervention , for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriation be necessary .
the guideline , a adopt by the Commission , be very limited because , instead of meet the aim of provide guidance , they be provide a shopping list of possible measure , a shopping list which , a it fail to set priority in ascend order , could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guide them towards a series of proposal that be at odds with the desired concentration .
we could say that , in this state of affair , we have once again miss the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and , hence the destruction of the countryside .
rural area must truly be see a a resource which should be increasingly invest in , by encourage young people to remain in rural area in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration .
a genuine flaw in the guideline be specific guideline for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy.The fact that this coordination be be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need & quot ; guideline & quot ; .
I must also stress that once again the Commission be , in fact , skirt the issue of practical action on equal opportunity .
in conclusion , the document be not particularly satisfactory , and in some aspect be disappointing .
Berend Report ( A5-0107 / 1999 )
. ( PT ) We basically agree with the assessment and the thought put forward by the rapporteur concern the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the region of the European Union .
we shall therefore confine ourselves to highlight a few issue .
firstly , and a the Commission itself state , it must be understood that the great improvement see by some of the poorest region in their per caput GDP between 1991 and 1996 be largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculate the Community average from 1991 onwards .
this obviously cause a slight reduction in the Union & apos ; s per caput GDP level .
we also feel that it be particularly important to state that the recovery see in some region - where it do actually take place - be accompany only to a limited extent by growth in employment.This consequently impose the need for new development strategy , with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be pay to this area .
this situation show that it would be a mistake to leave adopt measure for promote employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States , which be what the report propose .
finally , but no le importantly , I would like to refer to the rapporteur & apos ; s proposal that , in future , this type of report should also include , amongst other issue , an analysis of the way cohesion be develop between the region within each State .
the huge variety of situation and the varying development see from region to region within the same State mean that there be a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue.This kind of assessment would enable u to allow and guarantee correction to regional ( and other ) policy with a view also to guarantee internal cohesion within each Member State .
. ( FR ) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union & apos ; s declare ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment , the analysis of merger carry out by the Commission should take element other than competition into consideration .
a an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power.A sizeable delegation of employee of this firm from throughout Europe be visit Strasbourg today .
the management of ABB Alsthom Power , follow a merger carry out in June 1999 , announce restructuring where there be already the prospect of layoff in a number of country .
this damaging situation for employment raise many question , particularly regard the information give to the European Works Council , in existence since 1996 .
it suggest that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be update and strengthen .
it also require the monitoring of merger take employment , the environment and consumer into consideration .
since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs do not go far enough in this respect , I abstain .
( PT ) By propose to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy , the Commission be devolve to national authority and court the responsibility to take decision and deal with abuse of dominant position in relation to company agreement which create market distortion.Issues of merger and state aid however , still remain within the notification system .
the position that have now be adopt aim to create more rapid way of apply competition policy , move towards apply Community law in national court rather than at the European Court of Justice , and even aim at have specialise court .
this partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher cost for Member States .
on the other hand , a the rapporteur point out , in the name of competition policy , public monopoly be often exchange for private monopoly , with the privatisation of important industry and public company , a have happen in Portugal , with harmful consequence for the country and it worker .
- ( FR ) The Commission & apos ; s White Paper on the modernisation of the rule implement Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty ( now 81 and 82 ) certainly do not propose any & quot ; renationalisation & quot ; of competition policy , a some Members of the European Parliament fear .
but it do , at least , make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting option for development of the European Union .
in fact , take note of the congestion of it service due to the prior notification system of state agreement likely to cause distortion in trade , and afraid of see the number of notification increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States , the Commission be propose to do away with the prior notification system of such agreement , and to apply competition rule at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion .
the most remarkable thing , in my view , be the message convey by this proposal : that the Commission be anticipate the consequence of enlargement and realise that this necessarily , and virtually automatically , require reform of the centralised system .
admittedly , this reform be one of increase flexibility rather than dismantle .
indeed , the White Paper envisage that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system .
moreover , the von Wogau report , which the European Parliament have just vote on , support it in so do .
but at the same time , one can clearly see that the upheaval cause by enlargement may lead to Community competence be limited and subsidiarity be extend .
it be a quite different Europe which be take shape in the long term .
be this not , indeed , what be so distress to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament ?
the German Social Democrats vote against the von Wogau report because , in their view , it might break up European policy on competition , which be to say , in plain term , attack the standardise superstate .
Curiously , a number of employer agree with them , prefer the European & quot ; one-stop & quot ; system , which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally .
indeed , this be one advantage of the present system .
but , on the other hand , the wider view must also be take , namely that the initial decentralisation which have be begin today may , in the long term , lead to greater freedom to take the requirement of each country into account , and this will be of benefit to everyone .
Rapkay Report ( A5-0078 / 1999 )
the Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrière Party shall not be vote in favour of these report on European competition policy .
competition be a war which have major concern fight each other , which constantly take the form of layoff , factory closure , not to mention extensive waste of production capacity .
we see a further example of this with the planned layoff in Europe propose by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power .
eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union , despite it be one of the wealthiest region in the world : these be the result of this competition which the European institution intend to promote .
the Commission & apos ; s declare intention to regulate the condition of competition on the European market be ridiculous , for the only law which competition respect be the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest element .
this be repulsive most of all in social term .
the European Commission & apos ; s report be a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institution have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporation who be engage in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victim this cause .
there be nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment , nothing to protect employee , nothing to prevent the major concern drive part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholder richer still !
we acknowledge that this report do have one good point - it show that the work class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institution in term of safeguard their living condition , and still le of improve them .
- ( FR ) In vote against this report , we be act a spokesperson for all the men and woman who in Seattle and throughout Europe express their rejection of a world reduce to strict commercial logic .
we be vote against this report on behalf of the development of public service , in memory of the victim of the Paddington rail disaster , kill not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulation .
this report be essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle , for it be not competition that can solve the problem face humanity at this turn of the century .
whether it be a matter of the balance of the biosphere , culture or cooperation with the third world , excessive competition be a factor increase regression and insecurity .
do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe be victim of too reticent an application of this competition policy ?
we be convince that the opposite be true , and we do not think that state aid be by definition excessive .
excessive in comparison with what iron rule , what criterion of efficiency ?
finally , after Seattle , do you really think you can advocate increase the role of the WTO ?
only the legal adviser to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness .
Jonckheer Report ( A5-0087 / 1999 )
I be pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU , and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report , and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be make information , both general and specific , publicly accessible via it website .
I be happy with the rapporteur & apos ; s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this .
there be too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly a a measure cause distortion in competition .
admittedly , an effective competition policy be a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union .
however , a the rapporteur point out , such aid be occasionally essential and may , in addition to enable the survival of a specific firm , make it possible to contribute to sustainable development ( Article 6 of the Treaty ) , service of general economic interest ( Article 16 ) and economic and social cohesion ( Article 158 ) .
clearly though , it must be monitor , a task which fall to the European Commission .
the aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sector under consideration reach a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997 , include 40 % allocate to the manufacturing sector .
this aid be considerably le than the previous period , 1993-1995 ( a 13 % drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8 % to 2.6 % in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ) .
this downturn in aid be chiefly due to the reduction in aid grant to the new German Länder .
like the rapporteur , I deplore the fact that the figure give in the report do not cover all state aid .
the European Commission must make good these omission a soon a possible .
it must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time , which be to say in time for the ninth report .
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission publish a register specify the amount of state aid per Member State .
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament have be totally exclude from the Advisory Committee on State Aid .
in order to compensate for this situation , the European Commission should be oblige to make regular report to u .
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel be particularly dangerous : the matter of aid result in business relocate from one Member State to another , with the risk of subsidy hunt which make no contribution to the share objective of the EU .
this be why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment , industry and craft business in the beneficiary country .
Langen Report ( A5-0073 / 1999 )
in the important debate on competition this morning , I express my view on Mr Langen & apos ; s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code .
just a the Court of Justice recognise in it order of 3 May 1996 , the iron and steel industry be particularly sensitive to disturbance to it competitive operation .
establish a system of aid to this sector intend to ensure the survival of successful firm be therefore justifiable , even though Article 4 ( c ) , of the ECSC Treaty prohibit any sort of state aid to the steel industry .
this , indeed , be the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code .
at the same time , it be , of course , essential to avoid any disturbance of competition condition or of the market , hence the importance of regulate such aid .
it be therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development , environmental protection and aid grant in the event of plant closure .
in the same way , it be vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid grant to their steel undertaking , a stipulate under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code .
the Commission suggest that Member States submit their report within a time limit of two month follow the end of each six-month period or , at least , annually , without the need for reminder .
like the rapporteur , I be pleased with the Commission report , but I do deplore the fact that the report do not cover every aspect of the aid .
although the Steel Aid Code be express in a very clear way , the Commission have , on a number of occasion , authorise aid for the steel industry even though such aid do not fall within the category set out in the code .
in the interest of equality , there be ground to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wish to authorise type of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment .
finally , we have the problem of the consequence of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty .
the aid system must effectively be continue beyond 2002 .
my feeling in this respect be that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not cover by the code .
for all these reason I vote in favour of the Langen report , and I now await the Commission & apos ; s response to our request and demand .
( the sitting be suspend at 1.05 p.m. and resume at 3 p.m . )
oil slick off the French coast
the next item be the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast .
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission .
Mr President , I shall be speak on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , but also a an elected representative for Brittany , and I be therefore directly concern and shock by these event .
together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group , we table a motion for a resolution .
I be pleased to see that we have today arrive at a compromise motion .
the Erika shipwreck be a truly European issue , firstly because it be disfigure and pollute some of the most beautiful beach in Europe , with extremely serious consequence for tourism , people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalist , and also because the underlying issue be the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale .
a disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occur along the American coastline , and why ?
because the Americans manage to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act , which make the party concern aware of their responsibility , a it make it possible to hold the charterer liable , and be more restrictive , and , more especially , more carefully monitored thanks to various regulation and , in particular , the existence of the American coastguard .
if , I repeat , we have have regulation of this type , then this disaster would surely not have occur .
this be why we think that the applicable legislation must be review , particularly the 1992 protocol which have exempt the shipowner , in this case the oil tanker charterer , from any liability .
well , if the charterer be exonerate , then of course he be le concerned with the inspection which oil company be responsible for .
the regulation must therefore be review , and I thank you , Commissioner , for highlight the inadequate feature of current European regulation .
moreover , a you say , monitor must above all be step up : that of the flag state , that of the classification society .
you tell u that RINA be an Italian classification register recognise by the Commission .
what be the condition for this recognition ?
what guarantee be there of it reliability ?
you be go to commission a fact-finding mission .
we await the outcome with great interest .
inspection by the maritime authority and supervision within European port must also be tighten up .
there be a Paris Memorandum in existence , let me remind you , which stipulate a minimum for inspection , that be , one in four of the vessel put into European port must be inspect by the maritime authority of the country concern .
this obligation be not respect either in France or in many other European country .
why not ?
what conclusions have the Commission already draw or what conclusion be it go to draw ?
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer be responsible for , in this case , the oil company .
if the charterer & apos ; s liability entail a financial commitment , then doubtless the inspection will be enforce to a greater extent .
finally , we need some coordination of national maritime authority in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguard who supervise the coast of the United States .
firstly , I would like to thank the environment colleague in my group who approach this particular problem jointly with their transport team .
this disaster be both a transport and environmental one and be not confine to one area .
here we be here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster .
I could reel off the list of disaster that have afflict this industry in my 10 year in this Parliament but I only have three minute .
surely it be now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that be know a the International Maritime Organisation , and last but not least , the oil company and tanker owner take on their responsibility by act to stop these ecological and human tragedy repeat themselves year after year .
how many more Erikas do we have to endure before the power that be deliver to u a proper port state control that be effective throughout the whole of the European Union , not just certain area of it ?
how much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry deliver u tanker with segregated tank and double hold ?
how many more seabird be to die before ship company end the practice of clean their tank at sea which , a our resolution point out , cause far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster ?
while I recognise that some progress have be make in area like port state control and minimal crewing standard , we be still face with what our late colleague Ken Stewart use to call & apos ; ship of shame sailing in and out of our European Union water : rust bucket badly crew & apos ; .
we need the Member States to act quickly and decisively .
we need our government to put up the financial resource need to give u effective control and we need them also to stop drag their foot when it come to maritime safety .
the Erika cost no human live but it may have ruin many human livelihoods.Just a the Sea Empress , just a the Braer do .
it be absolutely certain that all three leave u with an ecological disaster .
my group & apos ; s sympathy go out to the people of Brittany who have see their area despoil by this disaster , just a my group & apos ; s sympathy go out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasion .
be it not about time that we stop express sympathy and start issue enforcement notice to get rid of these ship of shame in favour of safe sea or we will be back again , later on this year , discuss a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly go down spew it crude oil all over the sea .
the time for resolution have pass .
what be now need be action .
sadly , I fear , the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discuss yet another maritime and ecological disaster .
Mr President , every time there be a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again .
in reality we can never stop accident happen at sea , but it be incumbent upon u all to learn the lesson whenever an incident of this kind take place and apply those lesson to reduce risk in future .
the & quot ; Erika & quot ; incident be serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected , but it be devastate for the wildlife of much of Europe .
some say that it be the worst accident that have ever befall the bird life of this part of Europe .
the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believe that a many a 400,000 bird , perhaps mainly guillemot , may have die .
the picture many of u will have see of oil-soaked bird be put down by veterinary official be both distress and tragic .
we all want the highest standard for ship whatever flag they may be fly .
we need to enforce the regulation and ensure that the & quot ; polluter pay & quot ; principle be apply so that financial penalty and some incentive be use to put pressure on both ship operator and oil company to ensure that best practice be introduce .
I agree with every word the Commissioner say in her remark , but the question be , how long will it take to ensure that measure be introduce to deal with the problem in the way she propose ?
a a politician she need to remind her official how difficult it would be be she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year , be a similar incident , just a devastate , to take place , if some of the measure she have propose today be simply still remain a fine word and she have not have the chance to put them into practice .
the thought of an incident of this kind occur in the near future should concentrate her mind and the mind of her official wonderfully .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have bring you a small gift.Here be a cake of oil send by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who write to me a follow : & quot ; with every tide , the beach be cover with heavy fuel oil which have leak out of the Erika .
with every tide , the volunteer , member of the armed force and fireman remove great pancake of this thick , sticky , black tar .
when will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastate accident ? & quot ;
indeed this disaster involve the Erika , like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey , moreover , be unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology be available .
it be all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty year after the Amoco Cadiz disaster , despite our say at the time and many time since , & quot ; Never again ! & quot ;
it be , of course , the responsibility of policy , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport .
we absolutely have to guarantee our citizen that a disaster of this type will never happen again .
but , listen to you , Commissioner , we be somewhat frustrated because anyone already involve in these matter know that in 1992 , I believe , the Commission and Parliament draw up a very interesting text which already contain all the proposal include in the resolution draw up by the transport committee .
indeed , we must say and keep say that the Erika be one disaster too many .
this be why it be essential , a a matter of urgency , for the European Union to undertake a radical review of it directive on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulation determine the responsibility of the owner of the cargo .
we should be aware , for example , that Shell and British Petroleum refuse to use the Erika to transport their oil .
why , in these circumstance , be the liability of Total a charterer not recognise ?
your proposal must also include make double hull mandatory and enforce observance , at last , of the ban on degas at sea .
a European inspection body must be establish which can monitor the condition of vessel effectively and efficiently .
in addition , it be also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO , a a matter of urgency .
what point be there in issue restrictive directive if , once they be at sea , most vessel do just what they wish ?
finally , a compassionate thought for all the volunteer , nature lover and bird lover , who spontaneously and generously be come through to the aid of the oil-covered bird , organise rescue operation with the mean available .
I can testify to this remarkable work .
you be no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 bird be go to die a a result of this oil slick , which be a major ecological disaster , practically unprecedented in scale .
in relation to this , you be no doubt also aware how difficult it be nowadays to preserve natural specie a well a natural space .
and , on this subject , Commissioner , you do not mention how the Commission intend to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitat .
once again , there will be no clearly define party responsible .
in the meantime , it be nature that be take the rap , a always .
Mr President , my group ask that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express it solidarity with the people directly affect by this ecological disaster , affect both in term of their economic activity and in term of their attachment to their natural environment .
let me , in this connection , welcome the presence in the visitor & apos ; gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque , spokesperson for the oil slick action group & quot ; Marée noire & quot ; , make up of men and woman from the French department of Morbihan .
many volunteer from France and other European country have express their solidarity by lend a hand to the victim in the field .
our proposal be particularly concern with the age of oil tanker .
among those inspect and find to be in contravention of regulation last year , 15 be at least 20 year old and some be 30 and more .
this be no longer tolerable .
next , we have flag of convenience .
accord to the International Transport Federation , over 40 % of the ship wreck in 1998 be sail under flag of convenience , the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human being at the expense of safety .
this be no longer tolerable .
finally , there be the lack of transparency .
everything be do to make the line of responsibility , the identity of the owner and real decision-makers a impenetrable a possible .
this be no longer tolerable .
in all these respect we must ensure real , significant change , include set a time limit for the switch to new standard , include the mandatory double hull , on pain of be ban from the port or the territorial water of Member States .
we must also ensure increase strictness both in issue sea-worthiness certificate and in monitor the condition and the maintenance of vessel .
finally we must ensure that all the party responsible for disaster contribute to repair the damage cause .
I be think specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance .
this be an approach , Mr President , which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation .
in so do , it will have prove it usefulness to public opinion which , in this instance , be await clear , tangible action .
Mr President , Commissioner , a a Member for the French Atlantic coast , for Vendée , I should first like to express the disgust of the people who be the victim of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disaster , cause not by a natural disaster such a the hurricane which have also just strike u , but by a crime .
in this emergency , in this ordeal , we have see a magnificent display of solidarity : local solidarity , national solidarity , and intergovernmental solidarity .
quite clearly , we be now pay the price for our lack of concern .
because our state , with the blessing of the Community , do not deem it useful to have it own commercial fleet and allow meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear , we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessel and we can see veritable coffin ship navigate our water under flag of convenience , drift accord to the short-term interest of the multinationals .
it be absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility , irresponsible charterers , untraceable shipowner and lenient certification company .
so today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion .
obviously , such matter should be handle at world level , but the current international regulation of the IMO be far from adequate and be far too loose , and neither our own country nor the Community have try determinedly to make them stricter , despite previous disaster .
admittedly , there be the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund , IOPCF , but it water down the issue of liability and set it ceiling at a quite inadequate level , which must be review .
the question of flag of convenience must be review within the IMO .
it be up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiative to achieve this .
let me remind you that the Erika be sail under a flag of convenience , that of a state apply for membership of the European Union .
in addition , there be Community directive , but they be seldom apply , if at all , due to the insufficient number of national inspector .
this omission must be remedied a a matter of urgency .
a directive on maritime safety have be in preparation for many year , but it be make very slow progress .
the Commission be display intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcoming .
the date when the Commission be suppose to present it communication devote to this key issue be put off time and again.It be now schedule for July .
the term of the regulation to be enforce must be particularly clear and strict .
I shall mention three issue that our group feel be priority .
firstly , the liability of owner of oil cargo must be clearly establish and the victim of pollution incident must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally .
the best form of prevention we can offer for the future be the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalise in civil , criminal and financial term if they be not extremely vigilant regard the matter of the safety of the vessel they select .
secondly , the requirement of the double hull a a condition for access to Community water must be enforce a soon a possible and cease to be put off indefinitely .
thirdly , a strict age limit on vessel to be give access to Community water must be establish in the near future .
this could be of a maximum of 15 year of age .
thus , the Erika be refused access to American water .
if the European Community have do the same , a great disaster would have be avoid .
let u ensure , Mr President , Commissioner , that this time we really do learn the lesson , even after the medium hype and the shock of this House have die down .
Mr President , Torrey Canyon , Olympic Bravery , Haven , Amoco Cadiz , Gino , Tanio , so many name we remember with horror .
and now the Erika .
whose turn be next ?
twenty one year after Amoco Cadiz , this umpteenth oil slick , the seventh since 1967 , show the irresponsibility of our successive ruler .
the Atlantic West Coast once again be pay a high price for their inability to react , for their capitulation to the multinationals .
it be hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept , and why Europe , normally so quick to pass environmental legislation , have choose to overlook the matter of maritime safety .
and this be the result .
the Erika , a vessel fly a Maltese flag , a floating rust bucket , class amongst the most dangerous type of oil tanker , have contaminate more than 400 km of our coastline , a case of pollution even worse than that cause by the Amoco Cadiz .
a an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region , unfortunately , I can testify to this .
there be nothing natural about these recur disaster , they be the result of fate .
they be the result of human thoughtlessness .
what we have here be an ecological disaster .
only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass root could have any doubt about that .
it be also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism , fisherman , oyster farmer , shellfish farmer , people who make a living from the salt marsh , shopkeeper , etc .
the Erika disaster must be the last in the series .
first of all , we must shed some light on this shipwreck .
why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involve in the team of expert which have just be announce by the Commission ?
next , a a matter of urgency , we muss pas legislation , firstly , regard identification of the exact characteristic of good transport .
in fact , accord to the expert , the oil the Erika be carry be suppose to sink to the bottom and should never have reach the coast .
we know what actually happen .
next , reliable technical inspection must be establish like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicle more than five year old .
we must regulate the use of flag of convenience , make double hull mandatory for the transport of pollute or dangerous material , work on technological innovation in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbon at sea .
this would be a minimum requirement , I believe , on the dawn of the third millennium .
I have also table a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group .
Mr President , in the course of the last few year there have be a succession of serious tanker disaster world-wide and the countermeasure take have either be ineffective or not worth mentioning .
it be particularly bad this time , not least because it have affect a major European State ; an incident which could happen again at any time .
we urgently require a directive if we be to reduce these risks.The 15 clearly do not suffice .
these guarantee - make no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 thing .
no tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again.All those involve , include the transport agent , be responsible for any ensuing damage , and these individual be to provide satisfactory assurance .
this be the only way of afford the victim the opportunity to make their claim for compensation .
however , we must aim higher in the long-term , let there be no mistake about that .
in other word , we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system .
Mr President , may I start by say that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response .
many thanks for this .
this also mean that , in any case , I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she send on 10 January but also for the action point which she announce today .
the Erika disaster show that when sound traffic and transport regulation be lack at international and European level , nature and the environment come off second-best .
the damage suffer , also in ecological term , can not be express in money .
hence also this joint debate involve transport and environmental management Members .
during the Christmas break , when the Dutch medium receive attention for the Erika disaster , I have a look , just out of interest , on the Internet to see what arrangement be , in fact , already in place for the purpose of take relevant measure , especially after Premier Jospin have say that Europe should do more .
what I learn be that , actually , there be sufficient legislation in place but the problem be the lack of supervision .
could I highlight a few point which have also be touch upon by the Commissioner ?
first of all , the port-state control , accord to which 25 % of all ship require inspection .
I think that this 25 % should not only be enforce but that it should also be ensure that more inspection take place.So this 25 % should be increase .
furthermore , if a ship be no longer seaworthy , not only should the fact be examine , but a legal system should be introduce which state or recommend that the vessel should no longer be use .
but this be not in place .
Mr President , I would welcome some action in this area .
finally , a far a the technical requirement for ship be concern , some Members have already mention just now that , since 1999 in the United States , ship should in any case be double-hulled .
in my opinion , we should look further into this point , and I also think that the Marpol Treaty , which come into effect in 2001 , should be look at very closely .
Mr President , I would like to take a brief , critical look at the accession negotiation with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to , and admiration for , the many NGOs that have at least roll up their sleeve in order to save animal .
Mr President , we have already have this discussion so many time in the past .
we have achieve nothing so far , and we have be unable to reach agreement within the European Union .
that be why I will only believe that there be any point to have this debate today if what we be all say today , and what the Commissioner have announce here , actually lead to legislation be produce ; in other word , if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers : & quot ; you must push this through in the Council of Ministers & quot ; .
allow me to say first that what we be talk about be an environmental catastrophe , which also impact on the economy and threaten livelihood .
so what be we to do now ?
I have no intention of talk about past event ; rather I want to look to the future .
what be we to do now ?
I will tell you a few thing we should do .
of course , we need double-hulled vessel .
that go without say , but it be something that will only work through in the medium and long term .
so what do we need to happen immediately ?
we need technical testing of ship , that be obligatory technical test every two year , and no ship to be operate without the accompany certificate .
we need this at European level and internationally ; we need something like a TÜV , an organisation that undertake technical testing of motor vehicle in Germany , which be compulsory every two year .
if you do not have a certificate then you be not allow to operate the vehicle .
this be what we need for ship .
thirdly , we need to carry out check on these safety and insurance certificate in the port , that be in every port of the European Union .
any failure to produce these certificate must lead to the ship be lay up and prohibit from leave the port , regardless of all the port charge .
we must reach agreement here , in all the European Union & apos ; s port , from Marseilles , through to Rotterdam , to Wilhelmshaven , Cuxhaven , and wherever ship drop anchor .
fourthly , we need the shipowner to bear liability , and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million , but to the value of at least USD 400 million , to be cover per insurance certificate .
we also need the country whose flag the ship fly to bear liability .
we need to be sure that if need be , the country whose flag the ship be fly will accept liability .
this would be a marvellous exercise in supervision !
I can assure you that those country award flag would then take great care to avoid have to accept liability .
in the fifth place , we need there to be a guarantee that these demand will apply to all ship use the port and waterway of the European Union , and incidentally , that include the candidate country .
last but not least , we need a long memory , for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future .
environmental standard will be a recurring theme .
I would not like to have someone come and say that these requirement will lead to job loss in the port .
the union will have something to say a will industry .
a long memory will serve u well , lady and gentleman .
I be look at all those of you who have not exactly be at the forefront of the environmental movement .
just you go home and say : & quot ; we have not concern ourselves with standard to date & quot ; .
we need to have a long memory when it come to the demand be make in the port .
we need to have a long memory when we say : & quot ; for once we be united , at last a far a port charge and requirement be concern , and will not play one off against the other in the European Union . & quot ;
if we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few year & apos ; time !
Mr President , Mrs Roth-Behrendt express very many of my own thought .
we have now obtain a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measure .
but how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster have lead ?
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation & apos ; s introduction of the Plimsoll line , a marking which be introduce to prevent insurance fraud involve inferior vessel .
where be the sense of crisis which generation before u have ?
I consider that what we should adopt be the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speak about , the identification in the form of green mark on tanker which certain harbour in Europe have bring up for discussion .
we must also critically examine the classification society .
I do not think that we can accept their procedure .
we need independent procedure and procedure involve public control .
finally , I want to say that , when my country provide environmental aid to shipowner who wish to improve the quality of the environment , there be unit within the Commission who regard this a prohibit aid to shipyard .
within the Commission , the one hand do not know what the other hand be do .
it be not an acceptable procedure that measure to improve the environment , which be in keep with the Commission & apos ; s guideline , can not be take because these be consider to constitute prohibit aid to shipyard .
Mr President , we shall vote in favour of the GUE / NGL Group resolution because it denounce Total-Fina & apos ; s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flag of convenience and the use of superannuated vessel should be prohibit , or that double hull should be mandatory for oil tanker .
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage cause by the oil slick .
how can we stop similar disaster occur in future if we do not institute draconian measure against the major oil corporation , and indeed many others who , in order to make more profit , take the risk of make the world uninhabitable ?
how be it possible not to be outrage when a bank refuse to divulge the name of the Erika & apos ; s owner on the ground of professional confidentiality , without government react ?
the crux of the problem be that all government , and indeed all the European institution , acknowledge the right of major corporation such a Total-Fina and it ilk to maximise profit whether it be harmful to their employee or to the environment .
they accept the professional confidentiality of business and bank , even though this same confidentiality serf to conceal what be essentially criminal action .
in these circumstance , even the best resolution will remain little more than appeal to principle which be powerless to limit the great corporation & apos ; capacity to cause damage .
Mr President , I be in favour of tighten up the legislation on port state control and on classification society .
however , we must stick to the fact .
the ship Erika have be investigate four time in the course of the last two year .
the answer can not lie in the number of investigation but rather in guarantee the rigour with which the control be undertaken .
I have hear in the course of the discussion that have take place in the last few week that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the control .
I can not accept this .
if the Member States decide , in agreement with ourselves , that 25 % of ship be to be monitor on the basis of port state control , then they must also make the necessary personnel available .
the control must also be carry out in such a way that the inspector do not just go on board and check whether there be any fire extinguisher miss , rather there must be material test , for this ship obviously break up on account of material fatigue .
this can only be detect if control undertaken be more rigorous .
it should be our goal to ensure that port state control be not superficial , but include material test .
secondly , I also share the Commissioner & apos ; s observation and would like to encourage her to continue down this path .
if it should become apparent that one or more classification company have provide report by way of favour then they should be strike off the list of authorised classification company .
that be the only deterrent we have for prevent other classification company from follow suit .
Mrs Roth-Behrendt , we already have a TÜV ( organisation for safety testing ) for ship in the form of the classification company .
there be reputable company too .
you will be familiar with some reputable company , our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable company , but we must look carefully at exactly which company do not fulfil requirement , and these must be strike off the list .
finally , we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it want to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accede it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfil our requirement , for the environment be a communal entity and not something that we can divide up !
Mr President , Commissioner , the Erika sank near my home and be still there , with 20 000 tonne in it hold , the fate of which we be wait to discover .
it could have sink anywhere .
it happen to sink there , and Brittany , where I come from , should not apologise for the fact that geography have make it a peninsula , and the result be that it be often force to clear up after shipwreck .
my first thought be for the 26 Indian sailor , who be save but of whom nothing have be say .
there could have be death in this disaster and safety at sea mean , above all , men & apos ; s life .
by now they be far away .
it be a miracle that they be save .
so we be now experience the same thing that happen 20 year ago with the Amoco Cadiz ; a wreck on the North coast , a wreck on the South coast , a wreck on the West coast .
thing could well continue in the same way .
Commissioner , a time be very short , I would like to pick out the seven point which we feel , and you have already mention some of them , be essential to work on : double-hulled vessel in our water a soon a possible and the strictest possible state control of ports.In particular , we must ensure that classification society be compel to make their report public , a currently , we do not have access to them .
then , sanction must be harmonise between the 15 Member States ; they should not be different , but the same throughout the Union .
we must be tougher on vessel fly flag of convenience , not because they be necessarily bad boat , but because amongst these boat there be many bad one .
we must improve information on all of the world & apos ; s ship , but provision have already be make for this.We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them .
with regard to this matter , I would like to know who own the Erika , because the idea of a legal person under our law be one thing , but there be always real shareholder in the background.Where be the Erika & apos ; s owner ?
perhaps they be in lovely villa by lovely beach , get a nice tan .
we would like to know their name and their face .
finally , there must be improvement in the training of crew .
in our society there be no such thing a zero-risk , but we must at least ensure the greatest possible level of safety .
Mr President , I welcome the statement from the Commissioner .
have spend a lot of time at sea myself I be well aware of the sea & apos ; s power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ship and boat essential .
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who be deal with the consequence of the break up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika .
this have be an environmental disaster a well a a deplorable waste of resource .
it should be note that the oil industry , through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds , regard itself a liable under the 1969 Convention and it 1992 Protocol , for over 90 % of the estimated cost of this incident , or some USD 170 million .
this suggest to me that we should also look to the shipowner , to the flag state and the inspection authority to shoulder their share of the responsibility .
however , before we rush in with a whole raft of new measure and new regulation , let u look carefully at the exist arrangement to be sure that they be be properly implement .
better to heed call to amend and improve exist legislation than to embark on new proposal .
in that context I support call to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection .
I support call to ensure that the classification society effectively monitor vessel & apos ; structural condition and be hold accountable for their action .
call for design improvement in hull construction , especially double-hulled vessel , be sensible but take time to be implement throughout the fleet .
they be no substitute for rigorous regular inspection .
Mr President , I would like to thank my Socialist colleague , mainly in the committee on transport and the environment , who have not forget that this disaster also affect the fishing industry .
because , a well a the irreparable damage to the environment , the damage to the ecosystem and loss in the tourist industry , the oil slick deal a huge blow to the fishing industry , to the conservation of marine resource , and the damage coast line will take year to recover .
it be no accident , Commissioner , that the affected area be always those European region which be least developed , those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which , in the majority of case , do not have any other resource .
these be the same area , Commissioner , which already have to put up with the disrespectful activity of certain shipowner who empty the bilge of their vessel off their coast , without any control whatsoever .
I come from a region , Galicia , which have suffer similar accident in the past .
Brittany and Galicia , two European & apos ; Lands Ends & apos ; , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulation and transport crude oil in vessel which in themselves constitute potential oil slick .
I therefore believe that it be necessary to act in two way .
on the one hand , by ask the Commission , within the scope of aid to the fishing industry , to implement special measure to compensate for the effect of this catastrophe on the industry in the area affect , and also by ask them to demand , of international body and of themselves , tight control on ship which sail under flag of convenience .
in this regard , the current process of negotiation on Malta & apos ; s accession to the European Union must be use to ensure that this country rigorously monitor the oil tanker which sail under it flag .
on the other hand , prevention be essential .
Portugal be a country which have clearly demonstrate it sensitivity to issue relate to the sea .
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implement a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accident at European level , use all the mean at our disposal - technological , structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such a this from happen again in the future .
lastly , Mr President , I would like to highlight the work carry out by the volunteer and local authority , who remind me of old time when , a the then Mayoress , I live through similar situation .
we must thank those who , while defenceless and lacking in resource , have battle courageously against the grave effect that this disaster have have on coastal region , the marine ecosystem and European fishing stock .
Mr President , a chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I should like to congratulate the Commission , and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio , for her reaction to this incident , which have really shake the whole of Europe .
we , a the Committee on Transport , be prepare to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and , of course , we be likewise prepare to discuss , at a later date , the legal implication of this communication .
in addition , I should like to make a number of comment :
first , the Commission be right to concentrate it investigation on the liability of RINA , the Italian shipping register , because we need to know if Community law be apply .
that should be the starting point for our effort .
secondly , apart from the shipowner & apos ; liability , it would be a good idea in such case to examine the liability of the charterers , for example the oil company which be also responsible for cause ecological disaster like this and , of course , for restore the damage .
once we have do that , our reaction to the ecological disaster be fully justify .
however , this should not lead u to accuse the whole merchant marine , which be an important sector of the economy , cover a it do 1 / 3 of transport requirement , which be why our reaction need to be measure : strict , but correct .
I have no objection to examine an amendment make Community law stricter but , a other member have stress , we need to start with application , because there be already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact .
this legal framework be fairly advanced , at least if you compare it with what be happen at worldwide level and the Member States , under the supervision of the Commission , should endeavour to ensure that Community law be actually apply .
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that the unfortunate incident involve the Erika should in fact , a others have say this afternoon , constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where , since 1967 , there have be seventeen accident involve large oil tanker ; more than one every two year .
the economic and social damage , which we have speak about today , in term of the loss of job and fishing and tourist resource , be so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institution .
Commissioner , I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measure which be be adopt and implement .
I trust that these measure will , in a few month , give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive , possibly - which will put an end , once and for all , to these 21st Century pirate , who deprive u all of the wealth and beauty of the sea .
I would like to comment on one of the measure to be take , which be mention by the Commissioner and some of my colleague .
I be refer to the double hull , which consist of two layer of steel , with container divide into two tank .
Commissioner , there be many expert who consider that the double hull be not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called & apos ; ecological hull & apos ; in which case , in the event of an accident , the seawater penetrate the container and , a a result of pressure , the oil be transfer to other tank .
Commissioner , I believe that it be time to opt for the safest technically possible measure .
it be therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other country .
I believe that we can and must improve the exist legislation in this regard .
any cost-benefit analysis which truly take into account all the harm occasion to person and the environment by these accident , be bind to support this approach .
Mr President , Commissioner , I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that have be adopt and which will lead u , after each of our respective political group have rally together and express it feeling , finally to produce a joint resolution .
I think that give the dramatic circumstance , and a a matter of principle , it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several vote .
I think that it be quite obvious , and this be the first conclusion that can be draw from the Erika disaster , that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport .
public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area , common airspace , a common rail area and a single market , but not a common maritime area.I therefore believe that this be a project which must be open up with the absolute will to see it follow through and follow through in concrete term .
the Commissioner have suggest three main chapter which need to be draft and bring into line with our legislation , in which we can set standard .
I have also note , to my great satisfaction , that even the group advocate greater national sovereignty , or the eurosceptic group be call for Europe to regulate , and I think that this be in fact the right level to take action .
we sometimes regulate thing which could , by and large , remain subsidiary .
in this area we must respond to public opinion .
this be extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we be , when all be say and do , on the global scale merely a peninsula .
therefore , once our legislation have be bring into line , we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law.We must also put in place systematic control and finally apply the & apos ; polluter pay & apos ; principle of responsibility which be , of course , suppose to be a deterrent .
I have almost finish and I would like to say that I have personally request a public hearing of the Committee on Transport , which would enable u to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future consideration .
I hope that all political group will support u in our request for a public hearing .
Mr President , the oil tanker Erika , the ownership of which be veil by accommodation address on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which be hire by Total-Fina for the transport of oil , founder off the Breton coastline , with disastrous consequence .
the implication for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment be enormous .
the cause of the disaster must be seek in the weakened structure of the oil tanker .
so people be doubtful about the safety of ship which carry dangerous or pollute good .
the International Maritime Organisation have issue international rule in this connection .
States can carry out port inspection .
in Europe , legislation be stricter and it be compulsory to inspect 25 % of the incoming vessel accord to the port-state control directive .
however , it seem that none of the Member States meet this figure due to a lack of inspector .
it be clear that there be no lack of legislation .
in my opinion , the Commissioner be quite right .
where the scheme falter be in the enforcement of exist legislation .
but how be we now go to enforce this if there be indeed a lack of inspector , esteem European Commission ?
can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93 / 75 concern minimum requirement for vessel bind for or leave Community port and carry dangerous or pollute good will be implement correctly in all Member States ?
should it implementation not be more strictly monitor ?
would it not be beneficial , in the short term , follow the Rotterdam model , to inspect accord to a point system in which , for example , account be take of the ship & apos ; s age , whether it be single or double-hulled or whether it sail under a flag of convenience .
in short , to give priority to older sub-standard ship over ship which meet all quality requirement .
the Erika be build at a Japanese shipyard and be single-hulled .
there be four more sister ship in service at present .
construction of this type of ship be halt at the time because the risk of rust be especially high .
some of them also sail under the Maltese flag .
be we wait for the next accident to happen ?
would sanction not be appropriate , a the Commissioner state , for the classification society ?
RINA be currently the talk of the town .
Malta be enter the accession negotiation .
in my opinion , the European Union can only accept Malta if it be guarantee that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future .
I would be grateful if you could be discipline since we be run out of time , and this delay be go to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission .
Mr President , just before I go down into the Chamber , I receive an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who have choose to spend New Year & apos ; s Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of stay at home and celebrate with her relative .
like many other hundred of volunteer , she have see the destruction , wash bird and clean up after the people responsible who be not to be find on the coast on those evening and night when they really should have be require to be there .
like so many others , I too wonder where the people responsible be .
where be the shipowner and those who order the shipment when these disaster occur ?
perhaps it might be time for u to begin to consider establish a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime .
this be not the first time we have see oil slick , whether intentional or unintentional .
( the President cut the speaker off )
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleague for bring this motion before Parliament .
the environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonne of oil have be widely report in the British medium .
although Britain and France have have their difference recently , I can assure you that there be considerable sympathy in my country for all those affect .
TV picture of the damage do to your coastline and wildlife , in particular bird and the already dwindle fish stock , have bring back memory of similar British disaster , such a the Torrey Canyon in 1967 , and have prompt many British volunteer to help .
I salute these joint effort to repair the damage .
this be clearly a problem for all EU coastline which will require imaginative solution .
instead of allow the cost of these disaster to fall on the community most affected and insurance market such a Lloyds of London , we must develop new technology to retrieve from the sea much more than 10 % of the lose oil .
there be currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market pick up the tab .
ultimately , the polluter must pay .
in addition we must build on the Council directive deal with enforcement of international standard for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensure that the inspection goal of 25 % of ship call at EU port be meet and that a high standard of inspection be deliver .
moreover , although I be not oppose to shipowner register their vessel in their country of choice , I believe there be a need for stricter application of international regulation .
rather than ban flag of convenience , which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet , under the 1995 EU directive on port state control , national maritime authority must impose more effective sanction on flag state which fail to carry out their international treaty obligation .
I sincerely hope that , particularly during the French presidency later this year , the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these option , and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament .
Mr President , it feel quite strange to be stand here again today , a I have be do at regular interval for almost ten year , and all because of an accident cause by human hand and by a lack of human competence , and not by force majeure .
the victim be wait outside .
they want answer .
they do not want any more promise that we then fail to keep , or to see any effort that we then fail to follow through .
the citizen be right to ask : & quot ; do our region now count amongst those which be lose forever ? & quot ;
who will provide u with new job ?
when will those responsible at last understand that spar resource be not something we do for fun ; nor be it just a question of create a system for it own sake or a new study group , rather it be a joint European challenge .
that be why I welcome Mrs Palacio & apos ; s action plan with open arm .
it be equally important to note that & quot ; prevention be better than cure & quot ; .
but there be an art to that a well .
Deploying the German multipurpose ship & quot ; Neuwerk & quot ; - it be right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entail the swift provision of European neighbourly help .
we be particularly in the debt of those who undertake the difficult deployment of all their crew .
valuable experience be gain , and also the knowledge that we can not master such environmental disaster use state-of-the-art technology alone .
we be therefore right to demand improved control , sanction and preventive measure .
I have be fight for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten year , here in Parliament .
the issue be a topical a it be before .
furthermore , I will not withhold my support but will endeavour , alongside my fellow MEPs , to bring about improvement and logical solution within the framework of European and international cooperation .
before the end of March , I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative text , that be to say , amendment of specific directive so that discussion may begin in the Council and in Parliament .
I would like to tell you that , in fact , it be not just an environmental problem - it be a very important environmental problem - but it be also a very important social problem .
there be men and woman who depend on fishing , gather shellfish and the service or tourist industry in these coastal areas.They be environmentally sensitive area , but they be also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium .
and therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation .
Mrs Roth-Behrendt say that nothing have ever be do .
in fact , I believe that thing have be do by the Commission , but there be still more to do .
this be demonstrate by the Americans who , after the Exxon Valdez disaster , within one year , adopt enormously rigorous and tough legislation , which threaten , a I say earlier , to divert ship unacceptable to American port towards Europe .
in Europe , after the Amoco Cadiz , or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast , in 1976 , or the Torrey Canyon , in the same year , or the many other case there have be , we really begin to legislate after 1994 and 1995 , particularly in the last few year .
during these year , the emphasis have mainly be on the safety of passenger transport .
that be the reality .
in my opinion , we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problem , also derive from American legislation , which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous good in the maritime sector .
I have refer to a series of issue which I will lay out in more detail , if you wish , in an appearance before a special committee on this matter , or when I present the actual initiative in the coming month .
my intention be - and I insist - for u to begin discussion after the end of March , also coincide with the Council of Ministers , and , of course , before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency , for u to have texts to discuss .
flag of convenience be one problem , but be not the only one .
the Romanian flag be not a flag of convenience but , nevertheless , that country have an extremely high number of incidence at inspection ; more than the country with flag of convenience .
Malta and Cyprus have ask to join the Community .
we must be demand on this issue and we be negotiate to this end .
this will oblige u to reconsider the register in the European Union , and to deal with the notorious problem , which will no doubt arise again , of the aim of a Community register .
I believe that this will be difficult but , in any event , we should carry out a review of the register of the European Union country .
a for the inspection , very much a key question , the first thing we have to consider be how the current legislation have work , a Mr Hatzidakis have say .
we already have legislation .
accord to the information which the Commission service have give me , this legislation be not adequately apply in many Member States due to a lack of personnel , mean and inspector .
the problem be not that only 25 % be inspect , but rather how we select , how we find , the ship which constitute the highest risk , through the age of the ship and the risk history of the flag .
unfortunately , the 25 % often consist of flag which be expect to fulfil the requirement : in this way inspection be quicker and the work be carry out more easily .
therefore , more than make amendment , we will have to implement measure to control what be already be do , apart from some supplementary requirement with regard to review , especially in relation to the age of the different vessel .
and that be why we have SOLAS ( the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ) and MARPOL ( the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships ) , two convention of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be make mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitor .
with regard to the question of Union inspector , I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspection be carry out by the Member States , which do not mean that the Commission do not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately .
lastly , I would like to stress the issue of liability.Not only in term of maximum sum insure , which I believe should be similar to those in the United States .
we have set a figure of USD 180 million ; in the United States they be talk about USD 1 billion a a maximum ceiling for cover claim payment .
I believe we have to increase the current amount so a to move closer to level in the United States , but that we also have to reconsider the sum insure on vessel and , therefore , the liability of shipowner , and also to hold liable those who charter ship , which be to say the owner of the cargo .
unless we require that the owner of the cargo be hold liable , we will never , in my opinion , resolve these problem .
I will end now .
I will not expand further.We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasion .
but , obviously , a some speaker have say - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant intervention - we can not allow a situation where , within one , two or three year , we have to say once again that we have not do what we should have do .
a for me , I can say , after have debate it in the College of Commissioners , that the Commission be prepare to present the necessary legislative measure , amendment and directive to Parliament and the Council , in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety .
the political will of this Parliament be require - and I can see that I can count on this - a well a that of the Council of Ministers .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
we have take good note of your intention .
I have receive 8 motion for resolution , in accordance with Rule 37 ( 2 ) , to close the present Commission statement .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m .
storm in Europe
the next item be the Commission statement on the storm in Europe .
Mr Barnier have the floor on behalf of the Commission .
Commissioner , I would like to thank you for the idea you have put forward , particularly on the very specific proposal concern the people affect and who be expect a lot from the European Union , in term of the help that we can offer them .
in the day immediately follow this terrible storm I write to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authority to redraw the boundary of Objective 2 so that all area devastate by the storm in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2 .
I think that you must have do so , because you have not mention it .
in fact , we all know that anyone who do not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid .
we should therefore put this situation right immediately .
you also know that this will not only be a short-term problem , but also a medium and long-term one .
let me explain .
I be in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroy around 20 % of deciduous forest .
indeed , for some & apos ; forestry & apos ; district , which have lose 20 % of their tree , this represent a huge loss .
we know , for example , that it take between 150 and 200 year for a tree to reach maturity , so the loss these town will suffer will not be spread over one , two or five year , but over many more .
the town concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 year .
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural town through subsidy for loss in their financial revenue .
I think that this be something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policy .
it be true that the problem of the forestry sector be an extremely complex one .
indeed , you speak of release fund for timber storage on the ground that it price must not depreciate .
on the other hand , district which have not be affect by the storm will also suffer , a the National Forestry Office have decide to freeze cut in forestation for four year .
those district which have not suffer loss will therefore see their income decrease in any case .
I be tell you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem be , and I thank the Commission once again for extend their analysis of this situation a far a it could .
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that , although there have indeed be an economic disaster , the real ecological catastrophe be still to come .
a you yourself say , Commissioner , these disaster or storm do not always have natural cause , and we think that these be the first sign of climate change .
we should therefore review our policy in order to take account of this fact .
Mr President , everyone who have travel here by car , train or aeroplane , have be able to see the extent of the damage , particularly in France , cause by hurricane of a completely unprecedented violence which strike Europe at the end of last month .
what can the Members of the European Parliament do when face with such a widespread disaster ?
firstly , I would like to pay tribute to the mayor and local representative who , on a daily basis , have have to reassure their constituent , organise volunteer and cooperate with the public service .
they have earn the confidence of their fellow-citizens .
next , I would like to thank the emergency service and the armed force of the Union & apos ; s Member States who , in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation , come to support the effort of their French colleague .
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid .
if this disaster have take place in Guatemala or Turkey , we could have immediately use the Community budget to help the victim , but in our own country nothing of the kind be possible because there be no suitable budget line with which to do so .
we must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authority and individual States from come to the assistance of business affect by the disaster by apply Community competition rule too strictly .
I be think in particular here of fish and shellfish company , which have be particularly badly hit .
a you say , Commissioner , we must ensure that there be compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeal can be make to FIFG for investment that have be totally wipe out .
beyond this , I think that implement MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal region that have be affect .
I therefore ask the Commission to stop do so and , on the contrary , to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investment , which they urgently need .
Mr President , the storm which devastate France during the night between 26 and 27 December have cause , a have be say , 90 death and damage to a value of FF 75 billion , i.e . EUR 11 billion .
almost three week after the disaster , several thousand people be still without electricity and telephone , 500 000 hectare of forestry land , or 100 million cubic metre of forest , have be ruin , and our historical heritage have also be affect , a the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates .
it seem quite natural that give such a disaster , national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated region and those people who have be worst affect .
we know full well that what you be do , Commissioner , and that be , limit yourself to give u the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefit from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b .
these be the term of the write answer you give Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000 .
I can show you a copy if you wish .
we would understand completely if you be not able to say anything else give the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission , but also of this Parliament , and if you can not do anything because there be no legal or financial framework for do so .
but for pity & apos ; s sake , and I be not say this to you in an aggressive way , please do not present appropriation which have previously be earmark under an unrelated regional policy a aid for victim of the storm .
a a matter of urgency , therefore , we must restore , within the framework of a supplementary budget , the budget line which be allocate to u for natural disaster .
we must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriation and we must change the forestry policy implement in most country in the Union.That , however , be another problem altogether .
Mr President , Commissioner , Europe have undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium .
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolence to the family in mourn a a result of the appal weather condition that devastate Europe in December .
these storm be an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forest .
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forest in my region , Lorraine , which have suffer enormous destruction .
I would like to congratulate the regional authority , the volunteer and the public service on the fantastic way in which they rally round but , unfortunately , their trouble be not yet over .
it be Europe & apos ; s duty to support them and thereby complement the effort of the government of Member States affect by the disaster .
I welcome Mr Barnier & apos ; s statement and I also welcome the measure which the Commission have announce .
I be certainly not forget the economic dimension of this matter , a the timber industry have be devastate and a whole population be suffer the tragic effect of this .
the Community action programme for civil protection , establish by a Council decision on 9 December , be launch on 1 January 2000 .
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity.This programme must work at full capacity .
although it may have be effective in certain area - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier & apos ; s word - unfortunately it be still in it infancy when it come to forestry .
our priority , a we wait for Community-level fund to be free up , be for material aid in term of partnership exchange between Member States .
it be therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest road , and to repair them a quickly a possible .
lend forestry equipment and make personnel qualify in forestry management available be also cover by this measure .
our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problem which could result from have to abandon large amount of wood in the forest , and from the pollution of ground water through have to store such large quantity of wood .
finally , it be essential that we slow down the logging of stand wood , in order to give priority to the purchase of windfall .
these timber sale should be support by strong medium coverage in Member States .
this aid for gather timber be , of course , only the first stage of an aid package , which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural area .
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be manage now that the emergency be over .
this be a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew it forestry heritage in line with the role that this play in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economy .
it be therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity .
if this solidarity be to have be worthwhile , it be up to Europe to propose priority action for safeguard the timber industry .
hurricane & quot ; Lothar & quot ; should prompt u not to abide solely by the principle of undertake repair once the damage be do - something which be discuss at a very superficial level here - , but to switch to the precautionary principle , under the term of which potential perpetrator be bring to book too .
current programme must be accelerate .
for example , a they stand , the Commission & apos ; s programme will preclude u from meet our obligation under Kyoto .
the trade in emission right be immoral to my mind and rather than solve the problem , it shelve it .
the entire taxation system must be give an environmental perspective in the medium term .
we must work more rapidly towards achieve the target stipulate in the White Paper for renewable energy source , a this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gas .
the new Commission have not put forward nearly enough on this subject , and what it have put forward be woefully inadequate !
Commissioner , Mr President , Lothar be a quite ordinary name hitherto .
however , it have now achieve notoriety .
the hurricane of the same name sweep across Europe claim numerous victim , mainly in France and Germany , but also in Switzerland , leave a trail of destruction in it wake .
the wind triumph over electricity pylon , roof , traffic sign and , ultimately over the forest .
we have hear that in a short space of time the storm leave u with approximately 120 million cubic metre of solid timber , and this be only an estimate .
I have listen to you very attentively Commissioner , and welcome with open arm the fact that you be intend to go and see for yourself the effect the catastrophe have have in France and in Germany .
if Mrs Schreyer be to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few day , then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him a an individual .
what would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happen not to be in an Objective 2 region , or in a 5b region ?
what answer will the Commission give , when it be on the scene , when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building , and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attraction etc . ? all this be well-intentioned advice .
however , I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we be already feel the effect of the immense damage .
the thinning-out we need be not be attend to ; the forest be not be tend to the requisite degree .
what we need the Commission to do a a matter of urgency be to approve national aid , so a to avoid the competition issue be raise again at a later date .
Mr President , Commissioner , permit me , first of all , to make reference to two fact .
firstly , at the beginning of 1999 , NATO , with the participation of most Member States of the European Union , flatten Kosovo with bomb in the name of freedom .
we be now endeavour , at huge cost , to get the country back on it foot again and help it people , and rightly so .
secondly , at the end of 1999 unbelievable storm rag bring death and destruction to vast tract of the EU .
the Commission in Brussels respond to the victim & apos ; cry for help with a shrugging of shoulder .
& quot ; we do not have the wherewithal for that , & quot ; they say .
this be wrong !
and no one can comprehend this attitude .
certainly those who fear for their livelihood be at a complete loss .
the citizen of the European Union expect solidarity , also from within this Community .
I say they have a right to solidarity .
indeed the European Parliament must make it it business to uphold this right in hour of need .
I urge the Commission not to keep have to be ask and to provide assistance for the victim of the storm .
it know the in and out of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority .
I call upon you , lady and gentleman , to support me in bring home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels office be lack be not so much the wherewithal for provide aid a the good will .
permit me one further comment.Although it be le evident in the case of the consequence of the storm , the tanker disaster off the French coast have make it very clear that we need to give the Commission a help hand on another matter .
the European Union need rule govern environmental liability a a matter of urgency .
we can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public have to foot the bill for damage that have often be cause by individual involve in criminal machination .
we must make the perpetrator liable for all manner of damage do to our environment .
then , for example , people will think twice before transport oil in a tanker that be about to fall apart .
when , in 1994 , over five year ago that be , I join the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament , I become rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier .
to this day I be still await an initiative from the Commission , which will actually enable me to start work .
it be a scandalous state of affair that must be end with all haste , and I hope that February do not see this dossier be postpone yet again !
Mr President , Commissioner , the storm that take place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise u into think about certain problem .
it have become clear that mankind continue to be unable to avoid natural disaster .
there have always be natural disaster and there always will be .
of course , there be a need for solidarity here .
there be certainly a need for European civil protection , and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line cover natural disaster .
but , most importantly , it be only ever man that make the mistake a far a the nature-mankind relationship be concern - despite the fact that the same mistake have often be make down through the century - and never nature , for nature can not make mistake .
the extent of the damage cause on this occasion be determine by the population density , the type of infrastructure , and , of course , the many monoculture , if we be talk forest .
of course , I be in favour of provide assistance where we can .
but when it come to aid , we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future , more emphasis should be place on lay electricity and telephone cabling underground .
we must take account of smaller cycle and plant stable mixed woodland when undertake reforestation , rather than monoculture .
the most important subject for discussion in this context be the climate .
to this day , we in Europe remain in the privileged position of have the Gulf Stream , and the Gulf Stream still do it stuff .
America and south-east Asia be have a much worse time of it a far a climate and storm go .
we be fortunate in have the Gulf Stream .
but in common with others , we too be have to endure the greenhouse effect .
this be partly the work of human hand , a difficult a it be to demonstrate climate change use calculation .
we must take more account of the guideline produce at the Kyoto environmental conference .
we must reduce CO2 emission , employ renewable energy , and generally make enquiry , in this connection , a to how the forest of Europe be fare .
Mr President , I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victim .
this be an irreparable loss .
secondly , we welcome the solidarity between the French department and citizen , and the solidarity of other country with France , which be the country worst affect .
a I have little time , Mr President , I would like to touch upon two element of our resolution .
I believe that the first one be implicitly recognise by the Commissioner in his speech when he wonder whether these catastrophe be natural or not .
that be to say that expert be ever more convinced that climate change and human activity , in general term , be link to the increase see in natural disaster in recent year .
in fact , over the last decade , the temperature have rise more than in the rest of the century .
therefore Europe must be clearly commit to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposal .
secondly , I be rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner & apos ; s proposal to create a European civil protection body .
furthermore , we should utilise an extraordinary budget line , since this be an extraordinarily catastrophic situation .
first of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the family and community that lose member in this terrible tragedy .
it be really the loss of life that make this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standard .
it be regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situation like this .
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and region that have tragedy like this .
that be important .
the other thing we should remember be that we do have a budget line in the past .
it be very small .
it be not able to do very much but it be repeatedly abuse by Members of this House propose action when the disaster be not even major .
official and minister from Member States be come to Brussels , whisper with the Commission and get a few euro and make a political point by bring aid back to their constituency .
so there be not much sympathy for this budget line when it be abolish .
I think we should reinstate this budget line .
when we have the earthquake in Greece , which be a big disaster , the Community have no instrument with which to offer it sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks .
the same when the flood come in France and the same again now .
these be major disaster , we should have an instrument , we do not have it .
we should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rule tight so that only in situation where grave disaster occur will we call up this particular instrument .
we can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happen we have an instrument to deal with it .
we do not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have have many serious wind storm on the Atlantic .
we have flood in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffer from these .
lady and gentleman , none of u must forget what have take place .
it be true that there be a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seek to discontinue emergency line .
it be nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what be allocate before the storm will now be free up to demonstrate practical , active solidarity .
it be nothing more than the States play at take from Peter in order to give to Paul .
this be inadequate , and I be personally delighted that Mr Barnier have state an idea close to my heart and which , moreover , I express when I tell the press in Bordeaux what I be hop for , and that be the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security .
if the European citizenship that we all want to see be to come into be , if the mandate that our President , Mrs Fontaine have stake on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe & apos ; s citizen be to be effective , our citizen must be able to feel that we be act with some urgency .
Mr President , Commissioner , when we compare the frequency with which storm occur in other part of the world with our own situation , we see that Europe get off relatively lightly .
nevertheless , the storm that take place in the last week of December show u what the consequence can be and that there be major problem in store for u .
anyone travel to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have be able to see for themselves that storm rag in Alsace a well .
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizen in the region where the storm rag so furiously , and at the same time , from my position here in this Chamber , point to how important it be to support these region and people .
each and every one of u know that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow .
what we need to do now be to deal with the fallen timber a swiftly a possible .
for it be common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hand if the fall timber be to be leave in the forest too long .
for instance , it should be point out that fallen timber provide the best breeding ground for the bark beetle & apos ; s larva , and we be not yet in a position to assess the repercussion this will have .
that be why it be absolutely essential to deal with the fall timber before the warmer weather arrive .
decade will have go by before we be able to determine the true extent of the damage sustain by the forestry industry .
for we all know how long it take a tree to grow .
the calculation be in decade rather than year .
in addition , I would like to point out that the forestry industry be certainly not just about timber production , for barrier woodland and woodland that act a a shield against avalanche also constitute an important factor in certain region .
I be therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry worker be also prepared .....
( the President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who be affect by the storm .
sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what be happen in other country .
we have very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank .
I be ask to highlight the result of the storm in Ireland .
we have high wind and unprecedented , prolong rainfall which , add to exist difficulty , result in thousand of acre be submerge , sometimes , in up to 15 foot of water .
we experience the human misery of flood home and farm , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disaster of E.coli-infected water .
I talk with farmer whose ewe be abort their lamb due to drink the infected water .
natural habitat be destroy .
so I ask that Ireland be remember in this particular case .
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force .
Mr President , Commissioner , I second all those who express their solidarity with the storm victim .
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe .
for the storm will have major implication for the forestry industry in all area of Europe , and I believe we need , in the long-term , to give thought to how problem of this kind be to be deal with in future .
we certainly do not want market organisation for forest , but maybe we should set up a system , perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector , which will make it possible to mitigate the implication for the victim in some way .
unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performance of this kind of major disaster in the future .
a have already be mention here , there be indication - no proof , but clear indication - that the increase in storm world-wide have to do with the climate catastrophe .
of course , the scientist do not all see eye to eye on this yet , but the majority of them be fairly convince that if we continue to emit greenhouse gas a we be do , these storm will , of course , hit u much harder still at the dawn of this new century .
I believe now be the right time for u to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours , Tom Spencer.He suggest that rather than give storm the name of men or woman , we should name them after the perpetrator of the greenhouse effect - he propose the oil company at the time .
however , an exception should certainly be make in the case of Shell and BP , for they have change policy and do not just base their sale on fossil fuel which be damage to the climate , rather they also invest in form of energy that have future viability .
we must be aware of this connection ;
I do not support those who make sweeping statement to the effect that the greenhouse effect be to blame for this storm , but one thing we can be relatively certain of be that we have reason to fear further catastrophe if we do not soon alter our course !
I have receive seven motion for resolution table pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
that conclude the debate .
the vote will be take at noon on Thursday .
food safety
the next item be the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission .
Mr President , I be very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outline to Parliament the main line of the Commission & apos ; s White Paper on food safety , adopt on Wednesday last , 12 January , in association with my colleague , Mr Liikanen .
at my hearing last September , I promise speedy delivery of this White Paper .
I be happy that we have be able to deliver so quickly .
the White Paper represent three to four month of intensive work since the new Commission be appoint last September .
it take on board the extensive consultation of the past couple of year since the Commission & apos ; s Green Paper on food law be publish .
equally it reflect our experience of recent food alert in such area a dioxin and sludge , a well a the BSE crisis .
the White Paper also reflect the concern of this Parliament which you have outline to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasion we have debate food safety in this House since the Commission be appoint .
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe & apos ; s food safety regime have be badly affect by the crisis and alert of recent year and month .
the Commission be fully commit to restore that confidence by put in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world .
when I launch the White Paper last week I say that the shopping trolley be one of the most potent weapon on the face of the earth .
the most discerning decision be make by the consumer of Europe .
if their confidence be damage this be reflect in shop decisions.This in turn have a dramatic effect on farmer , producer and industry generally .
in an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually , even a slight dip in confidence level can have significant effect .
between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there be over 10 million employee .
high level of confidence be necessary to boost job number and competitiveness .
this crisis of confidence have also have the unfortunate but inevitable effect of erode the trust of consumer in the system and institution at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standard of food safety .
in say all of this , I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless have one of the best food industry in the world and also one of the safest food control system .
the challenge be to make the system the very best .
the overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety be to put in place the necessary legislation and structure that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumer arise from the consumption of food .
we be set out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change .
the Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we be to achieve our ambition on schedule .
we will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholder .
the White Paper on food safety outline a comprehensive range of action need to complement and modernise exist EU food legislation .
all of these measure be design to make it more coherent , understandable and flexible .
we want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumer .
the detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper set a precise timetable for action over the next three year .
over 80 measure be envisage .
our objective be to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002 .
we be also envisage the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 a an essential complement to the new food safety regime .
this idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate .
it have already attract much comment , include reaction from Members of Parliament .
the chapter of the White Paper devote to the establishment of a European food authority be clearly design to elicit view and comment .
we be seek view by the end of April on what we envisage .
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moment .
the Commission believe that major structural change be require in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objective of assure the highest standard of food safety and restore consumer confidence .
why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change ?
the first key concern be independence .
key stakeholder , include consumer , be seek a system that be independent and perceive to be independent of all vested interest .
we must also ensure excellence and transparency .
we have make a lot of progress over the past couple of year since the reformed system of scientific advice be adopt a a consequence of the BSE crisis .
however , the Commission believe that we must go further .
we must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment .
the key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety .
we envisage that the work of the exist five Scientific Committees devote to food safety will be transfer to the authority .
they may not be transfer in their present form or structure - this be an issue on which we will elicit view before make our definitive proposal on the authority & apos ; s establishment .
however , if we be merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs , this would clearly not be enough .
a the White Paper make clear , the new authority must be a value-added structure .
I be of the view that the exist system of scientific advice need to be strengthen .
within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientist .
I be also envisage that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react , identify issue before they become crisis .
this proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority .
to be proactive the White Paper identify a number of new area that would be embrace by the authority .
these include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the EU , and build up strong network with food safety agency and body in Member States .
a part of it remit we also envisage the authority operate an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concern .
the Commission have decide that it be neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority .
we believe that decision in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission , Parliament and Council .
I make no apology for this approach ; I firmly believe that it be the correct one .
certainly there be those who would argue that we should give law-making power to such an authority .
I do not accept those view and reject them with some degree of passion .
it be only last year that the Treaty be amend to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process .
to give such a role to an authority at this stage would be , in my view , a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability .
I will be very interested to hear the view of Parliament itself in relation to this matter .
there be also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority .
I also reject this line of argument .
how could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety ?
would this be in the interest of Europe & apos ; s citizen ?
in my view , most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific argument be soundly base , rationally argue and fully justify .
it seem difficult to envisage such a situation evolving .
I can assure you here today that the Commission , in exercise it risk management function , will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority .
I have already say that the authority will be charge with develop network with national food safety agency and body in the Member States .
this be a major task .
we must develop greater certainty in the science that underpin food safety in the European Union .
the authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issue .
this situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time a confidence be gain in the authority itself .
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice base on science .
however , with the evolution of dynamic network with national scientific body and agency , the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage .
I be also anxious to hear the view of Parliament in this regard .
a an integral part of a value-added structure , the White Paper propose that the authority would have a major role in risk communication : to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way ; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk ; to be highly visible ; to tell the good news story about food ; to be proactive .
the White Paper also contain very important proposal in respect of control .
this be a hugely important component of the system of check and balance to ensure that Member States and operator be comply with Community legislation .
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena .
in this context we be also propose to strengthen significantly the control function carry out by the food and veterinary office locate in Dublin .
this revise Community framework would have three core element : operational criterion set up at Community level , Community control guideline , and enhance administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control .
a part of our proposal in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examine whether additional power in addition to infringement procedure need to be give to the Commission .
these could include withhold Community financial support or recoup funding already commit to a Member State .
these proposal must be see a part of our mission to have the highest food safety standard in the world , boost consumer confidence and increase market for farmer and producer in the Union .
in addition to the proposal for a new European food authority and an enhance control system at Community-level , the White Paper propose an action plan with a wide range of measure to improve and bring coherence to the Community & apos ; s legislation , cover all aspect of food product from farm to table .
it set out over 80 separate action that be envisage over the period ahead and intend to close identified loophole in current legislation .
the new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , contaminant and residue , novel food , additive , flavouring , packaging and irradiation .
a regard the precautionary principle , I might add that the Commission be currently finalise a communication which I expect to be adopt very soon .
I look forward to have a useful exchange of view this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have prefer to do this last week if there have be an appropriate parliamentary forum available .
however , have regard to my contact with the president of the relevant committee , I recognise that this be not feasible .
but I know too that we will have many further opportunity in the coming month to consider the White Paper & apos ; s proposal on the authority .
we now have a number of month to have the necessary debate on the Commission & apos ; s idea on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority .
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate .
Parliament play a crucial role in Europe & apos ; s response to the BSE crisis .
it have especially active since then in bring citizen & apos ; concern about food safety issue to the fore .
I expect that Parliament & apos ; s contribution to the debate on the authority can be a incisive and constructive .
while we have a number of month to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our view , I recognise fully that this be also a very tight timeframe .
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangement to ensure that it view can be formulate a quickly a possible .
it be essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament & apos ; s contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raise consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restore consumer confidence in the European Union & apos ; s food safety regime .
the European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU & apos ; s food safety regime in the year ahead .
it be essential that we get the mix right .
Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his statement .
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have make and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institution , include the Commission and Parliament .
that be very much the right approach .
but there be one word that I have not hear you mention here tonight .
I hope that we can thrash this out .
we need a body of food law , a you have say , and we need to agree this together .
it be very important that we include liability in that process .
that be the one word I be talk about .
the problem so far be that taxpayer pay when something go wrong .
that can not continue .
when we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there be a problem , those responsible be liable .
Mr President , it be a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority .
my question relate to the positive list for animal feed .
you be unclear about this in your White Paper .
what be your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ?
when will the same requirement be apply to animal feed and the production thereof a apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof ?
the final part of my question be a follow : when will BSE test be bind in all Member States ?
that be another point , i.e . the question of obligation , which you be somewhat unclear on in your White Paper .
thank you , Commissioner , for your statement .
I think the line that you have set up regard the Food Safety Authority be a recognition of reality .
the Member States would not accept a regulatory agency , so there be not very much point in your propose one .
some sector of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that be clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs .
however , a chairman of a committee which look a though it will be concern itself almost entirely with food over the next three year , I have to ask : if Europe have the safest food control system , a you have say , why do we need 24 new directive and regulation and 20 new amend directive ?
secondly , will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States ?
we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this .
regard enlargement : what plan do the Commission have to involve the applicant state in debate on these new law , give that the Commission clearly expect the law envisage in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003 ?
President , first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern , Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their word of support in relation to the White Paper .
I find that encourage and I look forward to further discussion with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issue that they raise .
Mrs Ahern raise the issue of liability .
that of course be not specifically address in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be put in place provision - and there be already some - relating to the issue of traceability .
once that be do , issue such a liability can be address .
I have not give full and detailed consideration to issue relate to and surround question of liability despite my background , but it seem to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issue involve .
but I have take on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration .
Mrs Roth-Behrendt ask me about establish a positive list .
that be one of the issue that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention be to establish a positive list for feed material .
at the moment the list be , a I say , a negative list and it be add to a require .
the establishment of the positive list be one of the issue set out in the annex with a date attach to it , 2002 in fact .
the rapid alert system for feed be something that we have identify a a gap in the legislation .
rapid alert be there for food but not for feed .
this be unfortunate and it be wrong , and we believe that it be important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be do .
the work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random test to identify level of infectivity in Member States be ongoing , I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt have ask me this question before and I say I think it be come along quickly but I understand it be in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work be currently under way .
I hope that the next time you ask me the question , I will be in a position to give you more detailed information .
Mrs Jackson have focus on the fact that there be 24 new and 20 amend piece of legislation and ask whether this compound over-regulation .
I should say that the piece of legislation that we have identify be intend to close gap in exist legislation .
it be not so much a matter of the establishment of new regime or further regulation , although that be part of it , but of identify where there be gap and loophole in the chain from farm to table and close them .
there be a reference to applicant state and that be something that we have in mind .
standard of food safety and indeed other area of safety be obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this be a matter that I have draw to the attention of Mr Verheugen .
Commissioner , the ignorance of certain Member States have land u in a major food crisis here in Europe , and I be afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council be in attendance , and that on the day that you present your interesting report .
what I would very much like you to tell me be how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind , whatever name it go by , will be give influence over the Council , who in this authority will have the say in matter , and who will issue order .
of course , we be not in a position to dictate anything in term of content , but I would insist on Parliament retain the right accord it under Maastricht and Amsterdam , and even extend them .
I very much fear that we be to have yet another authority that fly through Europe anonymously like a satellite ; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it do not come to that .
I also welcome the White Paper .
but do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have have and France & apos ; s refusal to lift the ban ?
you mention the Commission be able to withhold grant and subsidy from country who be act in the way that France be act .
would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payment for instance , similar to the one that the British farmer be ask for at the moment ?
Mr President , you say during last week & apos ; s information session that it be your view that any future EU food agency should not be locate on the periphery , but you do not mention what that periphery be .
for example , the work of the EU unit locate in Dublin have show that physical distance be no barrier these day to communication and have an effective influence on matter .
it have be suggest that the most important task of a future food authority will be to gather , publish and coordinate data , make recommendation for improve food safety , and - a you say - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumer .
all this will be manage with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union .
I would ask you on what you base your idea for a location ?
in relation to the makeup of the authority : first of all it will employ in-house scientist who will liaise with and consult with scientist who be expert in the particular field that be be consider at any particular time .
in addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .
you will notice in the White Paper that we have not be specific about the makeup of that board .
this be an issue which I expect will be discuss between Parliament and the Commission over the next few week and month .
I envisage that the board & apos ; s membership will be make up from stakeholder or representative of stakeholder .
it function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September .
we have not do that yet but it will be do in September .
I do not expect that the board will have any function in direct the scientist how to do their work .
that would erode the independence of the scientific advice .
but it would have an overall remit , particularly , for instance , in request the authority to investigate particular area require research .
Mr Florenz ask whether Parliament will have a say in that .
that be an issue for consideration and discussion .
there may be a number of view on that .
some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominee - to be member of the board .
others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament , through nominee or even MEPs themselves , be able to have an opportunity to discuss what issue should be investigate .
it be an issue for consideration but it have not be rule out .
Mr Florenz also raise the question of anonymity .
I be happy that he raise it because it be particularly important for this authority to have a high profile .
it must be visible .
it must be know .
consumer in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority .
the CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be know , who might appear regularly on television talk about issue relate to food , particularly in relation to the good news story surround food in relation to nutrition , diet and such issue , so that if another food crisis come along consumer will be aware of the existence of the authority .
they will be aware that they have hear from the authority before under other circumstance and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already build up in the pronouncement from the authority .
it be fundamentally essential therefore that the authority be not anonymous .
it must be visible .
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority .
Mrs Lynne ask whether the authority will have sufficient teeth .
I suspect that the question be focus on the issue of where the competence of the authority begin and end and where the competence and authority of food safety agency in Member States begin and end .
there would have to be an interaction at scientific level .
quite clearly it be undesirable to have situation develop whereby scientist work for , or advise , the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level .
that be an undesirable situation , we do not want that situation in the future .
there be a number of thing that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information be one .
but information which include a fundamental disagreement between scientist on core issue relate to food safety be also an issue of serious concern .
we must attempt to avoid that and establish the structure so a to ensure that there be a proper dissemination of information between scientist , that there be full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level have the opportunity and be mandate to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientist in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond , where expert be to be find elsewhere .
over time , a I say a moment ago , not only will the profile of the authority be raise but it expertise , it moral authority will be increase and enhance over a period of time so that it view be accept and not challenge .
this situation can be achieve over a period of time .
you can not legislate for consumer confidence.It be something that be earn over a period of time .
however , the Commission will have the possibility of see that the opinion of the Authority on scientific matter be enforce by way of pass legislation which be the function of the Commission , Parliament and Council .
I realise that this be a somewhat time-consuming exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arise out of the opinion of the Authority be - I believe - the way forward .
any failure to comply with legislation be a matter that can be deal with in the court in the normal way .
one of the issue that we may have to address over time be the question of the speed of response in such circumstance .
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get u a faster response from the court process .
in relation to grant and subsidy : yes , consideration have be give to that issue .
it will require the advice of legal service and that will be seek , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling .
in relation to Mrs Lynne & apos ; s question on interim payment : that be a matter that might very well be address by Parliament a it relate to budget issue .
Mrs Myller then ask me about the location of the Authority .
no decision have be take in relation to that other than to say that it be more likely that the Authority will be locate centrally rather than on the periphery .
I recognise that the FEO be locate in Dublin and , although I come from that part of the world myself , I have to accept that it be not the centre of Europe !
but the FVO be in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority .
the FVO be make up of independent scientist and vet and so on who travel from some location where there be an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin .
the Food Safety Authority & apos ; s situation be quite different .
it have to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientist involve in the Food Safety Authority and those of u who be involve in the initiation of legislation .
an important part of the communication between the two institution will obviously be to ensure that those of u who be involve in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it be the scientist mean , what problem they have identify , what legislation be necessary to deal with the issue they raise .
equally , the scientist will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process , to ensure that the legislation meet the ill that they have identify .
it seem to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally locate .
scientist will be employ in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientist on a consultative basis and , in those circumstance , a scientist will have to travel , it be probably better that they move to a central location , once again where the parliamentary structure and the Commission and Council be base .
that be my judgement at the moment .
it may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestion that be make but my preliminary conclusion be that this Authority should be locate centrally rather than on the periphery .
colleague , I be in a very difficult position because I can not change the agenda .
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political group and raise it in the Conference of Presidents .
if you feel that these session after a Commission statement be important , I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that be allocate to them .
on this occasion we have have six minute of question from the floor of the House and we have have 29 minute of response by the Commissioner , and his statement .
a you can see , half-an-hour be not really anything like enough time for such a session .
I hope you might discuss this in your political group so that we can have a better structure session with the Commission on such future occasion .
that conclude the debate .
question Time ( Commission )
the next item be Question Time ( B5-0003 / 2000 ) .We will examine question to the Commission .
we will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minute to Question Time .
we will cut back our time a little because the interpreter be work today in continuous session .
Mr Purvis have the floor for a procedural motion .
I object to the fact that we be cut back the time for Question Time ; it be one of the few occasion when backbencher have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hour a be on the agenda .
that be the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda .
the fact be that the agenda say that we would begin at 5.30 p.m. , and you can see the clock .
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event .
first Part
question No 28 by ( H-0781 / 99 ) :
what step will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accident and the proliferation of nuclear weapon in a country that wish to join the EU but spend enormous amount on nuclear programme while receive financial aid from the EU budget ?
Mr Verheugen have the floor on behalf of the Commission .
the Commission be follow with interest the plan construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu , Turkey and recognise the importance of ensure that the construction of the new plant follow the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standard .
accord to our information , the decision on the selection of a bidder have not be take yet .
the Commission acknowledge the fact that Turkey have sign and ratify the convention on nuclear safety and recognise that the responsibility for grant licence and regulate the siting , construction , commission , operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plant in Turkey rest entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority .
the Commission do not have a mandate to impose any limit on decision take by any country in term of energy production , include the nuclear option .
a Commissioner Wallström indicate during the hearing in the European Parliament in September 1999 , the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I be happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of day and will certainly raise the issue .
in particular , the Commission be aware of the public concern about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line locate in the vicinity of the propose plant site .
accord to information receive from the International Atomic Agency , the design of the plant take into account the possibility of earthquake stronger than any ever record in the area and particularly more than ten time stronger than the one register in June 1998 in Adana .
large design margin be be provide in order to ensure safe operation of the plant accord to the environmental condition of the site .
the Commission be also aware of concern about the possible intention of use the plant to produce weapons-grade material .
it acknowledge the fact that Turkey have sign and ratify the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and have subsequently conclude a comprehensive safeguard agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency .
thank you for your reply .
I should like to make the following point : Turkey be now a candidate country .
this plan be design to increase it energy potential by 2 % .
at the same time , it also wish to acquire Cadou type reactor from Canada , which we now know have already be use for nuclear weapon in Pakistan and India .
in this sense , there be therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus call for a nearby country with weapon grade nuclear technology .
so much for the political aspect .
now to the technical aspect.The safety factor in this type of project , and I be speak a an engineer , have nothing to do with increase safety level in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty .
in case such a this , where there be uncertainty , simulator be use .
however , we can not use simulator in case relate to nuclear energy .
in this sense , all high seismic risk area must be exclude a priori for nuclear installation such a this .
therefore , and give that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey have now change , it would be a good idea if Turkey discuss certain matter relate both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union .
a couple of week ago we have a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate country .
I have explain the position of the Commission .
you have to accept the fact that there be no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety .
so what we do be use political mean to convince some candidate country that we have to have decommission plan for some reactor that be consider not to be upgradable .
in the case of Turkey it be different .
the plant be not yet there .
I have already say that Turkey be part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety .
if we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there be concern about safety we will discuss it with Turkey .
if the conclusion be that Turkey be plan to build a nuclear power plant that do not meet normal European safety standard be concerned then we would do the same a we do with Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria .
Mr President , the Commissioner say that Turkey have sign the non-proliferation treaty , it have sign the nuclear safety treaty : why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey & apos ; s nuclear plant should not be just a safe a any in the Community , and would the Commissioner be prepare to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter ?
I think it be the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concern and fear .
I do not have these concern .
I believe that Turkey completely recognise the standard and the criterion of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty , but there be no doubt that there be concern in the public in Europe and I think it be quite right to discuss them here in Parliament .
question No 29 by ( H-0786 / 99 ) :
subject : depleted uranium weapon Has the Commission conduct any study of the potential effect upon EU state of transboundary pollution arise from the use of depleted uranium weapon in the Kosovan conflict ?
if not , why not ?
Mrs Wallström have the floor on behalf of the Commission .
thank you , Mr Bowe , for your question .
the European Commission have monitor the environmental effect of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action .
a early a last June the Commission finance a first study.It be carry out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and conclude that there have be no large-scale ecological catastrophe .
none of the subsequent evidence or analysis have overturn that original assessment .
the Commission have also be closely associate with the production of the recent report publish by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force .
this be the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effect of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet study it .
the use of depleted uranium weapon be one of the many issue consider and this report be now widely available also on the Net .
the Balkan Task Force be hamper by the fact that little or no information be available on the actual use of these weapon during the conflict .
no indication of contamination be find in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission .
however , this do not exclude the possibility that area in Kosovo be contaminate by depleted uranium .
from a desk assessment couple with a fact-finding mission the report conclude that the risk , if any , be limit to an area around the target .
future action will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe.A special regional environmental reconstruction plan be also be develop .
it will form the framework for emergency assistance for combat war damage if such action should be need .
first of all , Mr President , can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response .
clearly the Commission have give some consideration to this problem and I be pleased that these report which have be produce so far have look carefully at the issue .
but I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapon be about the way in which they be use .
this uranium become air-borne , be inhale and could now be effectively carry by member of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effect than it have be possible to establish so far .
this seem to be the pattern of event that have emerge after the use of depleted uranium weapon in the Gulf war .
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effect , not just of depleted uranium weapon but of some of the other effect on the environment that we do know have occur at least in a localised way within Kosovo ?
how long will you continue to monitor the effect of these weapon ?
thank you , Mr Bowe , for that question .
we have to state again that there be still no confirmation that deplete uranium be use in the conflict and no depleted uranium have be detect in the clean-up of Kosovo .
but those symptom and those problem that you mention could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium .
that be also mention in the report .
no transboundary effect have be detect and most of the weapon will have be use on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
the problem be that the current political isolation of the country mean that access to this area be restrict .
a big responsibility rest with the United Nations because they be address with this report , so they have to take responsibility .
but through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that be , for the time be , the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union .
it be important to follow up and it give the Member States , a well a the United Nations and the Commission , something to think about when it be a matter concern military secret and their effect on the environment .
it also have a long-term effect on thinking when it come to the use of these sort of weapon .
Mr President , Commissioner , in a few month & apos ; time , hundred of thousand of holidaymaker will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday .
we know from medium report that bomb and weapon be dump just off the coast .
be you able to confirm that holidaymaker will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer , and be there any measure in the pipeline for ascertain what the danger might be in this respect ?
I wish I could give guarantee for many thing but unfortunately I be not able to .
we make our judgement from report like this and the mission we send to check on thing like this .
that be what we rely on when we advise people on what to do .
what we have see be that war affect the environment in the long term and be dangerous .
in the environmental field we have just pass a directive on marine pollution .
that also include bullet and weapon and so on and it be an early warning system .
unfortunately we be not able to give guarantee and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise .
I want to ask the Commissioner whether it be true that soldier of the NATO arm force now station in that region undergo special control against nuclear radiation and that the same measure be not apply to civilian live in the area ?
I can not answer that question .
when it come to medical check and so on , I do not have all the information need to give a proper answer .
what we know from the environmental side be what I have already mention , that there be now an environmental reconstruction plan , but when it come to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that .
of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .
question No 30 by ( H-0793 / 99 ) :
subject : appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile receive over 4000 Tibetans who escape over the Himalayan mountain seek freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb .
many of the refugee have be severely frost-bitten and many have die along the way .
the Tibet Intergroup be very concerned about the worsen situation in Tibet and it be clear that the current policy of the European Union have prove inadequate to address the grave human right abuse face by Tibetans daily in Tibet .
when will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet ?
Mr Patten have the floor on behalf of the Commission .
the concern express by the European Parliament about Tibet be widely share .
I have long believe in the need to set out our view on human right issue , include Tibet , firmly and candidly to the Chinese authority .
the European Union do that at the European Union ­ China Summit in Peking last month where we press the Chinese on a number of human right issue , include Tibet .
we again urge the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama .
I urge the Chinese again to do so .
we will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authority .
we be also do a number of other thing : in the European Union-China human right dialogue , we have focus on a number of practical step , include send expert on assignment to Tibet , plan development assistance programme and activity focus on health , education and training for Tibetans .
the appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them .
but for my part , I be not sure that it would add much practical value to our effort .
it would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authority and we already have effective channel of communication with the Tibetan community in exile .
I be also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoy , however worthy the cause .
Mr President , Mr Patten , of course , you be very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spend in China , and you be well aware of how hard the Tibetans be try to initiate a debate , something which have always be block hitherto .
however , if your response be to be that we should turn to & quot ; Mr CFSP & quot ; , that be , to Mr Solana , then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter .
your approach , which I be very much in favour of , since it be a coherent one , take it inspiration from the issue of human right ;
I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human right .
Imprisonment , torture , the mutilation of young woman and so on and so forth , be definitely issue that we could discuss ad infinitum .
if we cut down here and say that the Council now share responsibility for this , then I fear that these human right issue will not be give the attention they deserve .
the possibility of stress the importance of business and trade in the first place , but also make very sure that we include human right in the equation , would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission , rather than say that it be a matter for the Council .
let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position be .
I state nothing but the truth when I say that the appointment of special envoy be a matter for the Council .
a it happen , we deal with the budgetary consequence , the Council make the appointment .
some may think that the budgetary point should be look at in due course .
put that on one side , because that be the situation , it do not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human right issue .
I be very much hoping in the next few month that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human right point out , among other thing , that there be no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human right in China or other place in the world and the trading and commercial interest and other interest of the European Union .
I have long believe that we should all recognise that country where it be best to do business be country that treat their own citizen most decently - everywhere in the world .
I repeat that we have make our position know to the Chinese on Tibet .
during the few month that I have be a Commissioner that have happen twice , first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest .
if I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member , who I recognise be interested in these subject , I recommend to him a book publish just before Christmas write by Isabel Hilton , the distinguished journalist , on the problem of Tibet .
Mr President , I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting , which betoken peace and happiness .
we be not just talk about human right and the environment where Tibet be concern , rather it be about a unique cultural heritage that be also able to communicate important value such a peace , serenity , compassion - a the Dalai Lama would say - to u Europeans .
the question before u now be what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness , the Dalai Lama & apos ; s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair ?
I would point out that do nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people .
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member have say about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition .
like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama .
it be an extremely move account , not just of his responsibility in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual view a well .
the Commission , like others , have urge dialogue .
the Dalai Lama have make it clear that peaceful dialogue be what he wish .
I wish that the Chinese authority have respond consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama .
at or around the time of President Clinton & apos ; s visit to China , the President of the People & apos ; s Republic of China give the impression that dialogue be on the agenda .
it would be very beneficial , not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia , but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People & apos ; s Republic of China if they be to respond to those attempt to begin a dialogue .
question No 31 by ( H-0795 / 99 ) :
subject : Commission & apos ; s rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper report , the Commission have reject the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizen ? right to proper administration in the EU .
although the Commission have itself approve the idea of legislation on proper administration , it have not now accept a detailed proposal that have be make , but have decide to issue a whole set of additional guideline on improve service .
be these report accurate ?
what be the reason for the Commission ? s act in this way , and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between it word and it action on the reform of EU administration ?
do the Commission consider that what have happen be compatible with the five-point programme agree between Parliament and the Commission in September , and be it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allow Parliament to express an opinion on it ?
Mr Patten have the floor on behalf of the Commission .
the newspaper report that the honourable Member make reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate .
in November 1999 the Commission approve at first read a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporate into it Rules of Procedure .
at the moment the Commission be consult it staff representative on the document , a process which will be finalise in the forthcoming week .
the Commission will then adopt the code at second reading .
it should be note that the new Commission give an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry relate to the code .
the Commission would like to stress in particular that , in the drafting of the code , it have take on board all the draft recommendation of the European Ombudsman .
the code will be a document exclusively deal with the relation of the Commission & apos ; s administration with the public .
it will be adopt through a legally-binding Commission decision to be publish in the Official Journal of the European Communities .
the document have be draw up take full account of the provision contain in the draft prepare by the European Ombudsman & apos ; s office .
accord to the related provision in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establish it Rules of Procedure be the Commission itself .
however , it go without say that the Commission adhere to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspect of administrative reform .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner .
however , I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force , bear in mind that it have be on the agenda since 1997 .
the newspaper report be mislead .
I do not think there be any difference between u and the Ombudsman .
there be a question about the legislative base on which we have take the best advice and I think we be soundly place on that .
I want to repeat that honourable Members , like the honourable Member who ask the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it .
it be extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member .
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive a a very positive answer .
for safety & apos ; s sake , I should like to have confirmation that it really be the case that , where the Commission and good administration be concern , there be no part of Jacob Söderman & apos ; s proposal which the Commission think be unacceptable .
be it true that the content of all part of the proposal will be approve ?
let me read what it say in my brief - and a it be in my brief it must be true ! & quot ; I would like to stress again that the Commission have accept all the Ombudsman & apos ; s recommendation contain in his draft recommendation of July 1999 & quot ; .
both document , that be the Commission & apos ; s document and the Ombudsman & apos ; s draft , cover largely the same ground .
the only substantial question that have arise be the legislative basis .
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there be no doubt that we be on all four with the Ombudsman on this important issue .
we will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten & apos ; s note into the bibliography , a another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind .
a the author be not present , Question No 32 lapse .
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy.I be sorry .
accord to the Rules of Procedure , you be not require to reply .
I wish you a good evening .
second Part
question to Mr Nielson , who be replace by Mr Patten
can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague , Mr Nielson , be that he could not be here but the honourable Members who be concern about these development question will know how important his mission be , try to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survive .
the Commission be prepare to look at the possibility of make an introduction to gender and development , part of the so-called induction course for new staff , something that have be do already but not , I admit , on a regular basis .
the training of staff move to the delegation in the different region be another entry point .
the training then would be automatically perform without be compulsory .
we also aim to include training in these issue in the basic training that our official receive in project cycle management .
a far a possible , we want to see this sort of training automatically build into programme at the outset , instead of have to be tackle separately and later .
my own view a a former development minister be that these issue should be mainstreamed themselves and tackle at the heart of training and not turn into a sort of optional add-on .
the quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all level .
it be not to be bring in a a & quot ; sort of optional add-on & quot ; .
this must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goal and strategy , together with a transformation of institution and process so that both woman & apos ; s and men & apos ; s priority and need be better reflect .
in addition , measure must be take to combat difference on the ground of gender .
equality must permeate not only project and programme but also all overarch goal , action plan and strategy .
it would appear that we be in agreement about this .
however , responsibility for ensure that due attention be give to equality lie with departmental and unit manager .
if the latter do not have the required professional competence , then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority .
extremely few member of the Directorate-General for Development , that be to say unit manager and more senior manager , have take part in the gender course that have be organise .
only one manager have participate in gender training , and for half a day .
that be naturally unacceptable .
what be the Commission prepare to do to ensure that unit manager and more senior manager go through the necessary gender training ?
gender have in fact be include in the compulsory introductory course for new employee , but then with only one to two hour devote to it on each course .
this limited training element have , however , be remove from all introductory course which have take place in recent time .
a I point out in my question , one to two day , and not one to two hour , need to be devote to the subject .
my question be this : be the Commission really prepare to comply with the adopt guideline for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development ?
well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so do my colleague Commissioner Nielson .
I must not go on about book , but I have just be read the book by David Landis Barnhill on what make some country prosperous and some country le prosperous and it be interest to see there the importance that he attach to gender issue , in the economic prosperity and political stability of society , go back millennium .
secondly , in my view , while the training that we be talk about should not be compulsory - after all there be no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential.And , since it should be essential , I would hope that everybody would make certain that they have adequate gender training .
that go for everybody at whatever level of seniority .
it be not something which more senior official can deem appropriate for their junior but think that they be too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves .
thirdly , one of the best approach to this issue be to integrate gender a an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular course for development official and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which be key to good management of project on the ground .
so I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member have say .
I hope the approach that we be follow both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of give this the attention which it deserve .
since 1991 , the Community have provide significant financial support to the New Independent States include the country of central Asia .
the major part of European Union aid have be provide under the TACIS programme .
in 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan receive technical assistance of EUR 75 million .
this assistance have deliver benefit in all sector , in particular agriculture , infrastructure development , the private economy and the strengthening of institution .
security consideration have prevent Tajikistan from benefit fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million have be in place in 1998 and 1999 .
in addition to national programme , the European Union have support important regional action in the energy , transport and environmental sector .
food security programme in central Asia begin in 1996 , follow two previous year when the European Union provide food aid in kind .
these programme have benefit Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent , Tajikistan .
funding for NGO programme in Tajikistan amount to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999 .
over the same period , Kyrgyzstan receive EUR 17 million .
since 1993 the Commission & apos ; s European Community Humanitarian Office , ECHO , have be active in support the most vulnerable group and sector in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan .
in 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million be grant to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan receive over EUR 35 million , mainly for food , medical supply , water and sanitation .
frequent monitoring and situation assessment have show that European Union assistance be contribute to the stability of these country and therefore the ongoing peace process .
Mr President , Commissioner , there be a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea become the Balkans of the 21st Century .
that be why it be imperative to stabilise the two major state of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular.That be why I would like to ask you what you be actually able to do within your own sphere of competence , how the negotiation with regard to the partnership agreement with these two country be go , that be , with regard to political relation that be .
of course , that fall within your remit ; my next question fall within Mr Nielson & apos ; s remit in that it concern environmental cooperation , in particular matter pertain to water and the problem surround the cotton monoculture , which be the cause of great aridity .
we be able , at the Istanbul Summit a couple of week ago , to meet and have discussion with some of the Central Asian republic .
I be very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them .
I can send the honourable Member , if he would like , a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreement with each of the Central Asian republic .
obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future be on the gloomy side .
but I have no doubt at all that he be right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia .
I have hear the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus a well .
so the honourable Member & apos ; s remark about the strategic importance of these region be extremely well make .
we be contribute to programme in the region which have some ecological impact .
our food programme be directly relate to structural reform in agriculture a well a poverty alleviation .
those programme themselves be intend to ensure that agriculture have a more soundly base position in those society and do not consist simply of rap the land .
there be an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to .
we also take good note of the fact that the Member who have ask the question have applaud the Commissioner & apos ; s answer .
this be not the usual state of affair .
and furthermore the Commissioner have not quote from his bibliography this time .
thank you very much , Mr Patten , for your intervention today .
question No 35 by ( H-0778 / 99 ) :
subject : Greek action plan for employment According to the finding of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment , Greece and Italy be the main target for criticism from the Commission for not properly carry out employment support measure and policy .
the report state that in Greece and Italy target for improve ? employability ? have not yet be reach and it be doubtful whether the policy to be implement will enable the guideline on preventing and deal with long-term unemployment to be comply with .
the report also comment that in Greece there be no plan for medium to long-term measure aim at reduce employment tax and insurance charge , or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resource to support employment policy , and , in addition , that there be no exact employment figure .
could the Commission say whether the Greek Government have make any specific commitment on how to tackle the problem of youth and long-term unemployment , and what these commitment be ? have the government legislate for and put into place a suitable system for pinpoint , record and monitor fluctuation in unemployment , or be most of the measure perhaps still limit to count those out of work ?
a far a Mr Papayannakis & apos ; question be concern , in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment , the Commission propose certain recommendation for Greece with a view to improve the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment .
the most important recommendation relate to the need to improve effort to reform public sector service , where problem exist , improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policy in accordance with guideline 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment .
the Greek Government introduce two specific programme in 1999 a part of it employment policy : & quot ; yes to Work & quot ; and & quot ; Back to Work & quot ; .
we do not yet have the final result of these programme and can not yet tell if the quantitative objective be achieve .
in the new programme submit for the period from 2000 to 2006 , which be be finance from the Social Fund , both the resource and the policy should be use , with the Commission & apos ; s support , to implement the objective which I refer to earlier .
the Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honour the commitment which it have make .
thank you , Commissioner for your reply .
you tell me that you , a the Commission , have make recommendation .
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendation will be adhere to .
however , my question for a very long time have be this : what happen with previous policy ?
do anyone find work ?
how many people find work ?
if you can not tell u for this year , then last year and the year before .
what have be do about training ?
be the purpose of the famous training centre to provide job for instructor or trainee ?
do we have any figure ?
in other word , do we have way of check what be happen with this government policy in Greece ?
Mr Papayannakis , the only answer I can give you be that the Greek Government do indeed need to step up effort to introduce computerised statistical record and to set up structure so that the programme implement have the quantitative result which you mention , and so that monitoring can be carry out and use a a basis for formulate policy .
Greece have see an increase in the employment rate and , a far a I can see , an increase in productivity .
the action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guideline .
a you know , there be 22 guideline on which each country be evaluate .
they concern access to training , the ratio of men to woman with access to training , and special action for the long-term unemployed .
the Commission will endeavour , for all these specific guideline , to quantify the data and to obtain specific information base on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006 .
question No 36 by ( H-0782 / 99 ) :
subject : Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme have be approve in it entirety and whether there be disagreement between Denmark and the Commission in other area of social policy ?
the Danish pension scheme , the Efterløn , only allow people resident in Denmark and people who have complete the required period of employment in Denmark to retire .
some worker have complain to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire .
the Danish authority do not consider that they be oblige under Community law to pay this compensation to worker take early retirement who do not meet the condition require under Danish law .
it should be note that the current regulation on social security system do not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission have propose certain amendment to the regulation which be , however , still pending before the Council .
there be , a yet , no European Court case law on Efterløn , but it could validly be argue that the residence requirement be incompatible with general clause now in force ban discrimination on the ground of nationality .
the Commission service set up a procedure for joint meeting and discussion with the Danish Government with a view to find a common language and a common approach .
the last meeting on the subject be hold in November 1999 and we be wait for the Commission service & apos ; final proposal on whether or not infringement proceeding will be institute against Denmark .
I notice that the Commissioner do not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme a a whole have be approve by the Commission , but it be indirectly apparent that the answer be that it have not be .
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme have not be approve by the Commission .
the Commissioner also more than hint , of course , that a lot of consideration be be give to bring the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg , specifically on the ground that the scheme actually discriminate against non-Danish wage earner who be unable to fulfil the condition , due to the fact that they have not be in paid work for the period require under the Danish system .
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadline in connection with this matter , for it be a problem which need clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate .
so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question .
honourable Member , I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States be have problem interpret the directive and transpose them into national law .
this be one such case and discussion be under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter , to the benefit of the worker who meet the requirement and who , a thing stand , have a right to this pension .
I think that the answer be brief and clear .
of course it be a you say .
there will be no problem with Danish national within Denmark , that be not where the problem lie .
the problem be with Danish national or other national reside outside Denmark .
question No 37 by ( H-0791 / 99 ) :
a proposal have be draft for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctor .
the content of the proposal concern the average 48-hour work week of doctor , with the possibility , follow negotiation , of increase it to 54 hour .
the Council , Commission and Parliament be all agree on the content but there be disagreement on the transitional period for implement the directive .
Parliament have propose 4 year , the Commission 7 and the Council 13 .
this proposal be still be discuss by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure .
although there be this disagreement , I should stress that all three institution agree on the content and that every effort be be make to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concern an exceptionally large number of work doctor throughout Europe .
question No 38 by ( H-0805 / 99 ) :
subject : measure to advance gender equality One of the work group of Commissioners announce by President Prodi have a it objective the promotion of measure to advance gender equality ( gender mainstreaming ) .
which Commissioners be member of this group ?
how many meeting of the group have be hold to date ?
what concrete measure have be discuss ?
this question cover several individual matter .
it refer to the special Commission work group deal with question of equality .
the Commissioners take part be President Prodi , Vice-President Kinnock , Mr Reding and myself .
the meeting of the work group be open and the first meeting be hold on 11 January 2000 .
thank you very much , Commissioner , for your reply , although I regret the fact that this work group have take so long to meet , since this matter be of the greatest importance .
we trust this Commission , from the outset , to begin work on all issue relate to greater equality for men and woman .
I hope that , in the future , thing will change and meeting will become frequent , because there be many issue which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude , a quickly a possible , those measure which will promote greater equality between men and woman .
Mrs Avilés-Perea , that be an exhortation rather than a question .
but if the Commissioner wish to offer doctrine or good intention ...
allow me to say just one word.I agree that the work group should have meet earlier but at least , once it do , important decision be take straight away .
question No 39 by ( H-0807 / 99 ) :
subject : Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999 , the Commission adopt the Community & apos ; s EQUAL initiative , the aim of which be transnational cooperation to find and develop new mean of combat discrimination and inequality in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers .
under this umbrella , each Member State be to submit proposal in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country .
what criterion will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States & apos ; programme ?
which Community body will control the funding of the steer group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme be carry out exactly and correctly ?
the European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro.As the EQUAL initiative be a joint funding venture with the Member States , what will Greece & apos ; s contribution amount to ?
the EQUAL initiative be not restrict to certain group of people .
it purpose be to combat discrimination in the workplace .
the decision on this initiative be take in Berlin , where it be decide to take account of professional group of asylum seeker and to include them in it action .
this be an important aspect of this initiative .
the Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation.This be the same a the Social Fund regulation , i.e . EQUAL come under the Social Fund regulation .
it have be submit to Parliament and we expect Parliament & apos ; s opinion next month .
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirement and national plan define in accordance with agreed European strategy .
the Member States , i.e . the national government , have primary responsibility for set up the joint agency , submit proposal , select the proposal which the programme will implement and carry out primary control .
within the European Commission , the Directorate-General for Employment be responsible for implementation , while financial control be the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control , the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors .
the last question concern the amount grant .
Greece have be grant ECU 98 million.The contribution commitment be 80 % , rise to an 85 % contribution from the initiative for the island region , especially the remote Greek island , and a contribution by Greece of 15 % .
Mr President , I feel that the guideline for the Community EQUAL initiative , especially the four action describe in it , will result both in complicate bureaucracy and , paradoxically , a non-transparent structure .
for example , one wonder how a development partnership will prove it cooperative spirit or it representative capacity , a require by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guideline .
at the same time , the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation , the complicated demand of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structure , a these be the only structure which can meet such demand .
however , this contradict the stated aim of the general objective for decentralise action plan at the level of local authority and rural areas.However , at the same time , participation by those actually discriminate against , such a asylum seeker , immigrant and so on , be render impossible or merely symbolic .
finally , if you consider the overall amount , which be on the small side , - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objective be , I be afraid that all we shall succeed in do be to prove that unemployment be a bad thing .
first let me say that it would be a great help to u , now that we have reach the stage where this be be process by Parliament , if you could make specific proposal which we could take into account .
secondly , I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative be not to reduce unemployment , it can not possibly deal with the issue of reduce unemployment , or to support an increase in employment .
that be the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund , which have huge sum of money and exceptionally large resource at their disposal , especially for country like Greece .
the EQUAL initiative have a specific mission.To encourage , to assist promotion , to create statistic , to create study and agency to support those section of the population which suffer discrimination .
so what we be look for be cooperation between local group , between local authority and between country in order to exchange experience ; that be mainly what we be look for , and for experience to be transfer from one country to another so that it can be emulate .
this be the philosophy behind the initiative ; the budget be commensurate with it and our aim be for development agency , non-governmental organisation and local authority to be involve a much a possible , so that it can get a close to the people a possible .
question No 40 by ( H-0808 / 99 ) :
subject : Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establish a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation give exemption to religious organisation ( Art . 4.2 ) .
could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstance and the group within Article 13 ( TEU ) likely to be effect by such an exemption ?
a month ago , the Commission submit a proposal on equal treatment in employment , a prescribe in the Treaty , in order to implement Article 13 .
the ban on discrimination be the rule in the package of directive and programme which we submit .
at the Commission & apos ; s proposal and after approximately two year of consultation with social agency , Member States and the European Parliament , a number of exception have be make .
these exception relate to profession which must be exercise by person with a genuine professional qualification .
allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this .
in a religious school , it be logical for an exemption to be request and accept in order to ensure that the teacher be of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs .
that be the sort of exemption we be talk about .
clearly this be not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provision be only justify in the case of this special professional qualification .
this be a perverse interpretation of end discrimination .
for instance , religious school could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example : we do not want to employ you because you be a gay man or because you be a lesbian .
here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression .
surely what we should be do , and I hope you will agree , Commissioner , be engage the person to do the job on the basis of their capability , and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice , no matter how sincerely hold .
I must stress that this exemption be not a refusal of work for any reason , be it the reason which you mention , sexual orientation , ethnic discrimination or any other reason .
it allow a choice to be make only where special qualification be need which relate directly to the activity in question .
in other word , it be positive discrimination .
in the example which you mention , it be only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic .
that be the only form of exemption which be acceptable .
question No 41 by ( H-0813 / 99 ) :
do the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policy which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these woman , or will their plight once again be overlook by the new employment policy ?
obviously , the cohesion policy exist for less-favoured region and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds , the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy .
I should point out that the fund available for region with problem account for one third of the total budget .
the aim of these regional policy , which , of course , be implement under the jointly agree European guideline in each Member State , i.e . each Member State be responsible for implement this programme , be to increase opportunity for work for both men and woman .
I should point out that 70 % of funding for the period 2000-2006 , i.e . EUR 195 billion , will go to the less-favoured region of Europe .
with particular reference now to the question of access by woman to the opportunity which be create , I would like to say , first , that there be , via the Social Fund , an entire equal opportunity pillar which the Member States must implement , i.e . special policy for woman which must use Social Fund resource .
secondly , the LEADER initiative currently be study give special priority to development strategy which aim to give special support to woman in small enterprise in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism , with a view to increase the involvement of woman in agricultural region .
Commissioner , thank you for give me a well-intentioned answer , which have be rigorous and well-argued .
however , I can assure you that we do not , with the exist measure - which you have refer to - reach these severely less-favoured region .
they be area where there be much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those area where we work in cooperation , where almost none exists .
therefore , my question be whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policy on microcredits , which have bring result in cooperation , could be apply to those woman in severely less-favoured region , who have the odds stack against them .
I be very familiar with the programme which you refer to .
I can assure you that we be not reach the area where there be most need .
with these forecast of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecast of LEADER and rural development , we will not promote , a we should , employment amongst woman in the severely less-favoured region .
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of apply microcredit policy .
question No 42 by ( H-0817 / 99 ) :
can the Commission say what it precise intention be regard the presentation of a new social action programme ?
we estimate that the Commission & apos ; s new social action programme for the next five year will be ready at the end of this summer .
in order to complete the programme and be able to present it , we first need to complete our consultation with Parliament , the social partner and non-governmental organisation .
these discussion have already start , but we will need to take account of the result in Lisbon .
the Lisbon European Council be try to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society , economic policy and reform .
these result will be most important in shape the Commission & apos ; s social programme .
I have already tell the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be hold in April between Parliament and the Commission , after the Lisbon conference , so that all aspect can be discuss and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be draft .
clearly , any future social action programme should take account of development , for example within information technology , and , in time , become a modern social action programme .
we need to see which concrete alternative the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reach agreement .
firstly , I agree with you entirely.Account will be take of the information society ; that be something which I too mention .
social exclusion , the programme for woman , the effort we be make in the social protection area , everything need to be look at now in the light of the new reality of the information society .
secondly , there will obviously be timetable for the initiative within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implement .
where I can not commit myself be on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which , a you know , be not include in the article of the Treaty and there be no legal basis for social security question in the Treaty .
question No 44 by ( H-0819 / 99 ) :
subject : opportunity of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty , it should be possible for all EU citizen to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union .
however , for people with various kind of physical disability who be in need of special transport and personal assistance , freedom of movement be still highly restrict .
what measure be the Commission take to facilitate opportunity for the disabled in this area ?
on 26 November 1999 , the European Commission approve a package of measure to combat discrimination .
a far a the package in question and people with special need be concern , there be a directive which concentrate on combat discrimination , especially in the workplace .
the European Commission believe that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special need and , in the end , to promote the freedom of movement of these person .
of course , it be particularly important for people with special need to have access to mean of transport , service and all type of installation if they be to exercise their right to freedom of movement .
the European Commission have approve a proposal for a directive on special arrangement in bus , coach and other vehicle , so that people with special need with mobility problem and people use wheelchair have access to them .
in addition , you should know that , on 4 June 1998 , the Council approve the recommendation for a pan-European type of park permit to be introduce for people with special need , the aim of which be to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organise parking area throughout Europe .
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer .
my question in the first place concern the opportunity the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe .
it be quite an expensive business if you be to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you be in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage .
I be grateful for the fact that the Commission have adopt an action plan .
it be of course a prerequisite , however , that there be financial resource and mean of actually cross the border physically if you have a disability .
it would be interest to hear whether the Commission be also prepared to set aside financial resource for those who have disability , so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchair take them .
I refer to the directive which the Commission have propose on compulsory arrangement for mean of public transport , so that people with special need can use them .
it have not yet be pass by the Council ; it be at the consultation stage .
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be take at European level .
I think it be exceptionally difficult for u to specialise in aid programme for personal transport .
that be deal with either under special programme in education , for young people , for woman and for exchange or must be a matter for national policy .
question No 45 by ( H-0006 / 00 ) :
subject : compliance with Directive 96 / 71 / EC concern the posting of worker The posting of worker directive have still not be implement in Denmark , even though the deadline have pass .
the draft legislation before the Folketing do not contain any rule govern right of employed person under collective agreement .
pursuant to Article 3 ( 8 ) of the Directive , term and condition of employment must be in keep with the & apos ; collective agreement which have be conclude by the most representative employer & apos ; and labour organisation at national level and which be apply throughout national territory & apos ; .
however , such use of an agreement outside it specific scope can not be impose on the two side of industry without a legal basis .
there be therefore two possible solution : either the Directive be inapplicable in Denmark , or Denmark be require by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreement .
can the Commission confirm that the Directive concern the posting of worker be inapplicable in Denmark a far a & apos ; collective agreement ... declare universally applicable & apos ; ( cf.Article 3 ( 1 ) ) be concern , give that such universally applicable agreement do not exist under Danish law ?
the European Union posting of worker directive stipulates that the compulsory rule concern the term and condition of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to worker post to that country .
what it say it that one of two thing may apply , i.e . either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreement which have be declare to be the rule universally applicable to a specific sector .
because Denmark do not have a system for declare collective agreement to be universally applicable rule , provision must be make in the implementing legislation so that , apart from current condition of employment stipulate in legislation , the hour in universally applicable collective agreement , conclude by the most representative organisation , also apply to post worker .
in other word , to put it simply , Denmark have a choice : it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it .
discussion be be hold between the European Commission and Denmark , and Denmark be expect to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into it national legislation .
the deadline by which it have to answer the Commission & apos ; s question expire on 6 December 1999 and we have not receive a reply .
we be wait to see what the next move will be .
thank you for a very clear answer , the gist of which - if the interpretation be correct - be that the posting of worker directive entail an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreement .
firstly , no attempt be be make to change the system in Denmark or in any other country .
a I say earlier , there be always problem interpret the directive of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because system be very different from one country to another .
a far a your question be concern , this problem do not only apply to Denmark.It be not only Denmark which have matter pending .
five country have transpose this into national legislation and the rest be at the discussion stage .
what now need to be do , and this be the reason for the consultation and discussion between the Commission and the Danish Government , and with other government , be to find the best way forward , so that something which be decide at European level by all the Member States , and which constitute a general framework , can also include worker post to Denmark from other country .
and this be the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine government to move .
thank you very much , Commissioner , for your dedication .
you have fulfil your objective for today , which be to answer all the question .
we congratulate you .
since the time allocate to Questions to the Commission have elapse , Questions 46 to 68 will be reply to in writing .
that conclude Question Time .
( the sitting be suspend at 7.50 p.m. and resume at 9.00 p.m . )
1997 discharge
the Commissioner , Mrs Schreyer , be not here yet , but I hope , and expect , that she will arrive in the next few minute .
nevertheless , I recommend that we start , in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate , and particularly the rapporteur & apos ; s speech , from her office , if that be where she still be .
Mr President , I be sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not be here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise .
I would like to start by thank my colleague for their cooperation on this report , it would not be what it be today without that spirit of cooperation .
Mr President , early last year , the 1997 discharge be postpone because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resign Commission which could not enter into any commitment for the future .
in it resolution , this Parliament state that discharge could not be grant until we have receive serious , far-reaching proposal for reform from the new European Commission .
this report , therefore , appear at a crucial time , on the eve of Mr Kinnock & apos ; s reform .
it be an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reform to these plan .
in the period lead up to this , it already appear , on the basis of the initial draft , that the Commission have make very important pledge .
we ask for a whistle-blower & apos ; s regulation , and this be now in place .
Parliament want financial inspection and audit function to be separate .
this have now be do .
Parliament require a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets .
this be in place too .
Parliament ask the Commission to waive it excessive privilege .
it do this a well .
the Commission have also enter into commitment to cooperate with Parliament in term of SEM 2000 .
fundamental change will also be consider for the technical assistance office .
these be sound , first step which illustrate that , if this Parliament so wish , change be not only possible but can also be translate into action quickly .
we want more than that , however .
the Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme .
this be not only necessary for proper public administration , it be a conditio sine qua non of regain the trust of the European citizen .
we now demand from the European Commission clear pledge concern the following point .
firstly , Parliament must have complete access to all Commission document .
this , however , presuppose that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive document .
in the context of provide information , I would like to draw the Commission & apos ; s attention to the fact that we be very concerned about the present draft plan on public access to document .
if the current draft be correct , then this be a huge step backwards in comparison to today .
we must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisation with representation in Brussels be able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen be not .
neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body hold the copyright to public document .
we would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objection can more easily object to task which be unethical or unlawful .
furthermore , it should be the case that , if the Court of Auditors detect a mistake not just one year but two year run , the management should be hold responsible for it , and this will have an effect on chance of promotion .
ultimately , we also need to achieve better cooperation , of course , between the European Court of Auditors and it national counterpart .
this Parliament have also ask the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reform on 31 March of this year .
it should no longer be the case that , although Europe be an economic power , we have no political influence because , when the chip be down , we can not offer effective aid to area which desperately need it .
I would quote Gaza a an example .
it be unacceptable that the Commission complete the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that , a yet , it have be leave unused .
Mr President , since 1996 , the discharge have acquire a heavy , political significance .
it be one of the most powerful weapon Parliament have and must therefore be deploy with care .
this be why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow .
however , we be not surrender this weapon without place a time bomb in it place .
indeed , the 1999 discharge will not be give until all financial irregularity highlight by the Court of Auditors have be clear up .
finally , this discharge report be naturally address to the Commission.But this do not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put it own house in order .
a long a we have no status , we be not credible a a force for reform the Union.The reform of the European institution be necessary in order to be able to continue Europe & apos ; s development process .
we can not have a decisive and fair Europe unless it be also open and democratic .
all institution must now join force in order to work together towards build this type of Europe .
Mr President , the Committee on Industry decide to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we be not specifically ask to do so .
we go ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on , that be , by make sure that we take good care of taxpayer & apos ; money in Europe .
during the course of our work on this report it become clear that there be persistent problem in the spending area under the control of our budget .
they be not unique to 1997 and two strand seem to run through them .
the first be a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programme , particularly in third country , without sufficient assessment of the practicality of implementation and proper resourcing .
the second involve serious managerial shortcoming in the Commission , in particular in relation to coordination across department and management of external contract .
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increase workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resource .
that can not excuse everything that we come across .
citizen of Europe expect the European institution to be properly manage and they be right to do so .
that be why I want to echo the comment from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which have be promise to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock .
from what I have see of the reform process , it look good .
I saw some of Mr Kinnock & apos ; s paper today , I hear some of what he have to say .
I have every confidence that if we and the politician of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need .
but we need that reform process .
many of the general point raise in our committee & apos ; s report have be cover in Mrs van der Laan & apos ; s report .
it be an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it .
it seem to hit on all the right point without just be like some of the old report , a series of detail .
it group them together and that be very important .
there be two issue I would like to draw your attention to .
one be nuclear safety in Eastern Europe .
we have to get this right .
the Committee of Independent Experts say the Commission be not manage this properly .
we have to remedy that .
the second point be about scrutiny mechanism .
we need from the Commission material we can use to help u scrutinise spending .
we need proper information , give in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past .
it have be see a a bureaucratic process to be do a quickly a possible in a little time a possible .
I hope colleague in this House will support the ground for discharge for 1997 and , at the same time , that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which be long overdue .
only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restore .
Mr President , I be sure the Commission will be relieve to hear that the 97 discharge be unlikely to have the same impact a the 96 discharge which , a you be all so very well aware , lead to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission .
the Socialist Group will be vote to grant discharge .
I be sure you will be relieve to hear that a well .
but that be not to say that we be satisfied , and that everything in the garden be rosy .
it be clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission be long overdue .
it indicate , however , that we acknowledge that step be be make in the right direction .
I just want to outline some of the issue that we , a Socialists , have put down a amendment .
we hope these will be carry because they be important in the way that they will impact on future reform .
first of all , the immunity of official : this should be lift if and when request by a national prosecutor .
we need to make it much easier to prosecute official who be guilty of fraud and corruption .
it be critical to note that the Commission have too often fail to act on the reform recommend by the Court of Auditors .
the Court & apos ; s report be there for a reason , our response to it be there for a reason and it be important that it be follow through .
I have just hear now that an audit progress board be go to be set up by the Commission .
even if we hear nothing else , we know that be go in the right direction in term of the reform that we want to see .
too often we have put forward recommendation and they have not be act upon even though you have say very often that you will act on them .
we want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future .
the other issue be access to confidential document .
we have have problem in the past in term of our responsibility in carry out discharge because we have not have access to the document we should have have .
we understand that we also have a responsibility here , that if we be give document we must ensure that confidential document will indeed be keep confidential .
we have put down an amendment to that effect .
one issue which be refer to in the van der Laan report be the whole question of the Gaza hospital .
the situation there be totally unacceptable .
we will not put up with it for much longer and we be look for immediate action on that issue .
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan .
I do not usually bother congratulate people but I think she have produce a very cogent report and deserve our thanks .
Mr President , Commissioner , if we be honest , we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation .
we be discuss last year & apos ; s discharge , but also the Commission & apos ; s responsibility .
I would like to raise the problem which be still pile up high on our desk .
the assessment of whether or not the discharge will be grant also depend to some extent on where the emphasis be place .
it be about a Commission which be no more .
there be now a new Commission .
then it be logical to grant discharge , because how can the current Commissioner be blame where 1997 be concern ?
the problem remain and this give rise to doubt .
we have to take a decision now regard the Commission & apos ; s good intention , but there be still no structural outline for these good intention .
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month .
we be all very much anticipating this , but the fact be still miss at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge .
it be clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur have also struggle .
this dilemma stretch beyond the area which I have already list .
take , for example , the pledge make by the Commission.They look good in themselves .
I have read a few document write by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them .
but I will give two example from which it be not a evident that the good intention which the Commission have now express will lead to a good outcome : the public nature and confidentiality of document .
the previous speaker already say something about this .
a document be circulate at the moment - not at a low level , but at a high level within the Commission - which , instead of enhance the public nature of document , be have the opposite effect .
this be an illustration of empty pledge not necessarily lead to good result .
this also apply to whistle-blower .
Mr Kinnock have also devote some fine-sounding phrase to this subject but , at the same time , it be entirely unclear , at this moment when we have to make a decision , what , for example , happen with whistle-blower who want to get something off their chest and can not do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament .
we have still not have a response to crucial question of this type .
so there be doubt a to whether these pledge of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decision need to be make .
this also apply , for example , to the very real project which the Committee on Industry have introduce .
in my opinion , the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intention and with sound plan on personnel policy and financial management , but each Commissioner who be now responsible for an area which have have serious shortcoming in the past should come with sound plan in order to improve the situation and not with general , empty proposal .
at the moment , our group still feel sympathy for , and patience with , the Commission because it can not be hold responsible for a large proportion of the mistake make in the past , but this patience have a limit .
clear progress must be visible .
at present , we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposal , but it be not a foregone conclusion that it will do so .
finally , Mr President , the 1996 discharge be the beginning of the end of the last Commission .
I express the hope that - in fact , I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge be the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission.Otherwise this discharge will not have be of any value .
in assess the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge , the decision must be base upon what actually occur during the financial year concern , in this case in the course of 1997 .
in our Group , we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 be in any crucial way better than that for 1996 .
in that year , we vote against grant discharge .
a a result , we shall vote against grant discharge for 1997 , too .
we think that this picture of ours be confirm by the examination carry out by the Court of Auditors .
it be both good and necessary that reform have be promise .
so far , the promise which have be make be still , however , to be fulfil , especially where transparency be concern .
we be therefore go to vote in favour of the demand for reform which be present in the resolution , but against the granting of discharge .
Mr President , first of all , I have only positive comment to make on Mrs Van der Laan & apos ; s very expert work on this report .
the Union for a Europe of Nations Group can not vote for approve the account for 1997 .
the report on so-called discharge contain a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the account .
we support these critical remark , and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd , against this background , to vote in favour of approve the account .
it have not be possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor & apos ; s statement to the effect that the arrangement cover by the account be lawful , and we should regard it a extremely problematic if we , a Members of this Parliament , be to vote in favour of account without have any guarantee of the legality of the arrangement concern .
the majority have make their approval of the account conditional upon the new Commission & apos ; s implement a series of reform , so a to ensure that what we be familiar with from the previous Commission & apos ; s period of office be not repeat .
again , I must say that we be concern here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission & apos ; s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission & apos ; s accountability for the future .
we do not think that the new Commission , under any circumstance , could incur liability for the past .
we think it be wrong to talk about the Commission & apos ; s liability a an institution .
the mistake up until 1999 be attributable to those who have responsibility at that time , and we still have no way of know whether the new Commission can do any better .
by mean of this extraordinary procedure , Parliament be stop itself from place liability for the arrangement in 1997 squarely where it belong , namely with the previous Commission .
it be the 1996 account which lead to the downfall of the previous Commission , and the 1997 account be just a incriminating .
there be no reason why , against this background , we should agree to grant discharge .
a far a the decision to balance the account be concern , we shall abstain from voting , and where , finally , the motion for a resolution be concern , we shall attach most importance to the many correct instruction contain in this and vote in favour of it .
Mr President , the decision relate to discharge for the 1997 financial year be postpone because the erstwhile Commission , to whom it be to be grant , have step down before the appointed time and be only continue in office in a caretaker capacity .
Mrs van der Laan & apos ; s report - on which she have lavish a great deal of hard work , and for which we be indebted to her - propose that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997 .
one might ask how it be that the current Commission be to receive the discharge for it predecessor & apos ; s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mention this - particularly a the discharge for the previous year , 1996 , be deny .
that be just the way thing be , however .
in take over the mandate , the new Commission have to assume responsibility not just for the achievement of the past but also for the mistake make .
since , on account of the college system , discharge can only be grant to the Commission a a whole or , alternatively , deny or postpone , it be no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belong to the previous Commission that have yet to be discharge , crop up again a Members of this body .
this question ought to have be ask when the new Commission be appoint .
if Parliament vote in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control & apos ; s proposal this week and grant discharge , then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque .
for it be the third section of Mrs van der Laan & apos ; s report that be the most important , to my mind , namely the motion for a resolution .
the comment contain within , under eight heading , be an integral part of the discharge , the implementation of which form the basis of our decision .
in the course of the discharge procedure for the come year - that for 1998 be already under way - Parliament will have to examine , a a matter of urgency , whether or not it be too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997 .
we will be in a position to judge just a soon a the Commission present it reform programme .
we will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency , transparency and accountability , and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information , be be display vis-à-vis the discharge authority .
Mr President , we all recall that Parliament decide to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitment from the new European Commission regard internal reform .
in response to this the Commission have enter into various commitment and have certainly adopt many reform measure .
it be fair to say that the new President , Mr Prodi , and his team be certainly commit to implement the financial control requirement a lay down by this Parliament .
however , the reform of the European Commission must now be take in the context of the debate that be go to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policy and initiative .
exist EU treaty will be amend so a to ensure , for example , that the enlargement process can succeed .
I have no doubt further reform of EU institution will be analyse in this debate .
but from the perspective of small Member States it be important that , a the European Commission be reform , it must be do in a way that ensure that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission .
Mr President , the Commission be now to obtain it discharge for 1997 , but in reality it do not deserve it .
1997 be a matter for the old Commission and , therefore , the new Commission do not think that it can accept liability .
it be true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission & apos ; s remit.The new Commission have , on the other hand , undertaken to carry out a clean up exercise follow former scandal , and I must admit that I be not impress at all .
the old mindset which involve sweeping thing under the carpet and protect one & apos ; s friend unfortunately still exist .
there be some who think that it be more in our interest to let bygone be bygone and make a fresh start.I do not , however , think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy thing up properly .
I be refer here especially to the earlier scandal involve ECHO .
I be very indignant about the fact that it be so difficult to get any document hand over on this matter .
I be the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control , and I shall have a lot of difficulty carry out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information .
from the outside , it look a if the Commission have something to hide .
my investigation also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case .
the Commission be not put all it card on the table and be in that way repeat ancient practice on the part of the Commission .
it be this practice which lead to the Commission & apos ; s downfall .
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents.Otherwise , we can not carry out our work .
thank you , Commissioner Schreyer .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts
the next item be the report ( A5-0001 / 2000 ) by Mr van Hulten , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on action to be take on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission .
Mr President , this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent expert chair by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegation of fraud , nepotism and corruption in the European Commission .
on 15 March the committee publish it first report conclude that : & quot ; it be become difficult to find anyone who have even the slightest sense of responsibility & quot ; .
within a few hour of the presentation of the report President Santer announce the resignation of his entire team .
the resignation mark the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mire in allegation of scandal .
since then the Brussels landscape have change beyond recognition ; a new , reinvigorate Parliament have be elect and a new Commission confirm in office .
speak in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform , which contain 90 detailed recommendation and which we be debate today .
the new Commission have already take important step to move away from the way it use to function .
a code of conduct for Commissioners and their private office have be adopt .
in a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounce their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol , tobacco , petrol and consumer good .
new rule have be draw up and implement govern the appointment of senior official .
the number of department have be reduce .
the Commission , in my opinion , have show a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they be to be congratulate .
the overall aim of the reform must be to create a strong , honest European public administration equip to carry out it task in an effective and efficient manner ; an administration in which official be provide with the mean to carry out their task and be hold fully accountable at all level ; an administration that recognise and reward merit and encourage official to develop their full potential .
in order to achieve this , action be require in four area .
first , financial management and control within the Commission must be improve .
one of the main problem be the lack of a functioning system of financial control .
the Commission & apos ; s DGs must be make fully responsible for their own expenditure , include financial control .
a new independent audit system service must be set up .
DGs must publish their own annual account so a to enable a clear identification of problem area and set annual target for reduce fraud and irregularity .
in return for this greater degree of autonomy , manager must be make fully and personally responsible for their action .
it be clear that the transition to such a new system will take time .
change to the Financial Regulation will be require and Parliament must have it say on those change .
but while the Commission must ensure that it respect the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase , this must not be an excuse for inertia .
urgent change be require today .
second , the fight against fraud , mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthen , firstly by create a culture in which they can not thrive .
this require a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff a well a adequate training and secondly , by reinforce the exist mechanism for deal with fraud .
OLAF , the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be place under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal court , criminal offence commit against the financial interest of the Union by Members and official of the European institution .
a proposal can be make , a proposal should be make , on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty , by the middle of this year .
third , standard in European public life must be upheld .
the political crisis which lead to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrate the need for unambiguous and enforceable rule of conduct .
a number of code have since be introduce .
they must be assess by Parliament and should be make legally bind .
the European institution should follow the example of a number of country , most notably the United Kingdom , and institute a committee for standard in public life , with a mandate to give advice on professional ethic and rule of conduct in the European institution .
whistle-blower who act in good faith must be protect .
at the end of last year Mr Kinnock announce new measure for the protection of whistle-blower .
they must be implement without delay .
although such measure can never be an alternative for good management , they must be an escape valve when something go wrong .
crucially , reform must not be limit to the Commission .
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvement to it internal rule , administrative procedure and management practice .
finally , the Commission & apos ; s human resource policy must be modernise .
it be clearly no longer suit to the requirement of a modern , multinational organisation .
the social dialogue have often act a a brake on reform and it overhaul be long overdue .
a career with the European institution must become more attractive .
too many young , new official be leave their job after just a few year .
merit must be recognise and reward , specific skill training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade .
the promotion procedure must be make fairer and more transparent .
last but not least the pay and benefit package must be review .
it must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market condition .
it must be rid of some of it more outdated element ; and it must deal with the legitimate concern of the general public who can not understand why European civil servant should be pay an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open border , or pay a level of tax that be often well below that of Member States .
Commissioner Kinnock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform .
this communication must contain a clear timetable .
with a new Commission and a new Parliament up and run the momentum for reform be now a strong a it ever have be and probably ever will be .
enlargement of the Union be just a few year away .
now be the time for Europe to put it own house in order ; to instil in it institution - a the independent expert might have say - a sense of responsibility .
in June of last year Europe & apos ; s voter give a clear signal that they be feed up with endless story about mismanagement and nepotism .
there be a very simple way to deal with those story .
let u get rid of mismanagement and nepotism .
Mr President , I do not want to be misunderstand - I sincerely hope this do not happen - and I should therefore like to start by say that I be , of course , in favour of combat fraud and firmly support the appropriate , necessary reform .
this be not a straightforward issue and call for a much more wide-ranging analysis , but I shall restrict myself to raise only a few point , in order to make people more aware , if possible , of what we be talk about .
all the expert can provide information and news , formulate opinion and give advice , but , they have no political or elective responsibility , and rightly so .
I nevertheless believe that politician should look into what can be glean from an expert report and what can not be take en masse in a spirit which , on some occasion , I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive .
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few idea - that Parliament alone , and no one else , can exert an influence over it Members.If this be not the case , the European Parliament & apos ; s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermine in the come year , and this institution would not move forward , a it should .
it be just a important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or it committee any documentation .
Members of Parliament must possess the quality of morality , discipline and discretion over delegated issue innately , and these certainly can not be impose on them by anyone else .
I would point out that there be no European legal system , but that a different legal system exist in each Member State .
we run the risk of delegate issue relate to the same offence which will then be punish in different way .
I agree that an investigation system should be introduce , but I be also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and , in any case , the equal need for the right to a defence .
I be oppose to European Community official be accuse of criminal act at the drop of a hat : whistle-blowing be a method that have no place in the third millennium .
in conclusion , Mr President , Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy : we must implement reform which allow Parliament to grow and expand it power , not go into reverse .
this debate on the van Hulten report bring to a close one of the most traumatic period for the European institution since their creation in 1957 .
the refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget ; the motion of censure table in this House a year ago for differ reason ; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which lead to the mass resignation of the Commission itself , be now part of European folklore .
those of u involve in these historic event be well aware that none of the upheaval would have be cause have we not act with parliamentary power to press for change in the way in which the Commission operate .
remember that the Council of Ministers , absent again this evening from our debate , approve the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resign on 15 March .
now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already have the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September .
our greatest concern in the EPP be to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission be restore .
further step to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European people perceive that there be no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous official .
under no circumstance will we concede ground which we have win over the past few month , which we believe to be in the interest of openness and transparency .
we be therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcement in recent week by Commissioner Kinnock suggest policy proposal of various kind to be put in a White Paper shortly .
while convey a desire to proceed rapidly , it also give the impression that the Commission be in transmission rather than listen mode .
our concern be strengthen if the rumour report a few day ago be true - namely that the Commission want to limit severely the access of Parliament to information .
this be , after all , one of the cause of the downfall of the last Commission .
have the lesson not be learn ?
the knowledge that the framework relation between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiate lead to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debate his report in committee .
we could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be demean for Parliament to set out detailed instruction a to what we want the Commission to take up in it reform package .
the le precise , Mr van Hulten , we be in our resolution , the more room it give the Commission and your former colleague in the Council to do what they like .
we believe the vast number of recommendation of the Wise Men & apos ; s report should be implement .
we have , a the EPP-ED group , submit all the recommendation of the Wise Men & apos ; s report in committee and many of them have now be put into the report , entirely change the nature of the van Hulten report in committee .
we have resubmitted a few amendment which fell in committee , in particular , our desire to see the code of conduct revise specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you , Commissioner , accept - when we have our hearing last September - should be include in these code of conduct , particularly when consider appointment and promotion .
look to the future , we know that we be at the beginning of a long process of continue reform in the European Commission .
we want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission official acknowledge in the outside world - a reputation that have be darken by the inappropriate conduct of a few individual .
Commissioner , you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occur .
in a nutshell : there be programme be run for which there be insufficient staff resource available .
we urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing need of the Commission base on the essential activity for which it be responsible .
our position be make very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget .
we will be vigilant over the next five year to ensure the reform now be suggest be fully implement and will support effort make to modernise institution .
but , equally , we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should step be take which do not correspond to the openness promise by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination .
let u hope that we can avoid institutional upheaval by have an ongoing dialogue which assume from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in decide the outcome of Commission reform .
Mr President , I must start by apologise that I can not be nearly a dramatic a Mr Elles in my presentation .
can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report .
it be an excellent report .
it would have be wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that come from an external body because Parliament should have it own opinion on these issue .
it be right for u to have a focused report which be what Mr van Hulten have produce .
can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse .
yes , a lot of thing be lose by the Socialists but they have not be win in plenary yet , and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow .
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his effort so far .
he have be clear that his commitment have be to produce a radical change .
central to this be the attempt to produce and engender responsibility .
it be clear that this need to be develop at all level and it need to recognise the need of each level within the Commission .
it be clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation .
that be important .
we need to stop people pass the buck from one to another .
where failure be occur within the Commission we need to hold people responsible .
we need to be assure that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal .
this be natural elsewhere but it seem to be an extremely radical suggestion when it be put to the Commission .
we can not continue with a situation where incompetence , mismanagement and fraud be cost the European taxpayer money and provide them with a poor service .
I will give you one example of this .
in the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayer of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million .
it be clear that be not acceptable .
what happen to the person who be responsible for that miscalculation ?
we need a system which provide incentive and promotion and we need to see this promotion base on merit .
we recognise that most of the official within the Commission be extremely hard-working .
but we also recognise that some of the practice be outdated .
we look forward to read the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to work out the detail alongside the Commission because , unlike what Mr Elles have just say , the Commissioner have make a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March .
we also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouse should not throw stone .
the European Parliament have not exactly be clean in it approach to thing throughout it history .
we have a long way to go before we be perfect ourselves .
our own staff policy be outdated .
some of our work practice need radical reform .
I hope that the European Parliament will be hang onto the coattail of the Commission in this reform process .
we recognise the proposal on activity-based budgeting .
we recognise that mean discipline on the part of Commission official and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priority .
finally , can I say that the Commission need to work on it relationship with the public .
European taxpayer need to be re-assured .
the fate of the Commission , of the whole European Union , rest on delivery of this reform .
that be the key issue , delivery of these proposal .
Mr President , I would like to start by extend my compliment to the rapporteur , Mr van Hulten , on his first report .
I very much admire him for keep his spirit up at a time when he be inundate with so many amendment .
I think that the report draw up by the Wise Men have be useful and I think that it be also useful for this Parliament - a already state by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration be run .
we have submit an amendment to this effect .
from the many point make by Mr van Hulten in his report , I would like to highlight a few , not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly .
firstly , I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of document .
the Commission & apos ; s record leave a great deal to be desire .
we notice this when we have to investigate the Flechard affair , which , a it happen , have still not be sort out .
Curiously , very important document have go miss from the cabinet , even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General , and this be clearly something which should not happen .
if Parliament want to carry out proper inspection , these document must be available , and I would like to know what the Commission intend to do to improve this situation .
I would also like to say a few word about ex post financial control .
this have also be partly dealt with in the van Hulten report.I think it would be useful if we be to give report figure per category and per sector on how the budget be implement .
the general impression at present be that anything budget-related within Europe be bad .
it be clear that , over the past couple of year , we have notice an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure .
be this possible ?
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reform have to be carry out .
if we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten .
it be his first report here in plenary .
this be worth a compliment although I regret , of course , that he do not expound it in his own mother tongue .
it be a report which come about with difficulty and may well be too late .
in my opinion , this be mainly down to the wrangling between the two major group within our Committee on Budgetary Control .
let u be honest .
the second report of the Wise Men arrive in September .
we be now four month down the line .
meanwhile , Mr van Hulten have be inundate with amendment , more than 100 amendment in the first round .
he go back to work , rewrite his report and take into account the very many suggestion , but have to face nearly another 100 amendment in the second round .
my fear be that all of this have contribute to a report which be too detailed , too extensive and too late .
moreover , I have be inform that the Commission have approve a report - today of all day - on the reform of the Commission which will be distribute for further consultation to the various institution and also to our Parliament , I hope .
might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening ?
Mr van Hulten , my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempt in tomorrow afternoon & apos ; s plenary meeting to embellish this report .
after all , it make no sense to copy the many sound recommendation make by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report .
so tomorrow , if we vote against some amendment or against specific paragraph , this be certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report a a whole more readable .
in any case , it should be clear that my group , of course , fully back the recommendation make by the Committee of Wise Men .
in any event , I look forward to the document which be approve by the Commission today .
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February .
I have to inform you , Commissioner , that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauge for our group , gauge which should make it clear to u whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not .
I would like to end on the following point.Just a the White Paper on food safety be approve last week and release to public opinion with a clear deadline state , we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission .
I think that there be a need for this , a public opinion be look for change and , in any event , my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002 .
Mr President , this report be positive but , actually , we need more than this .
fraud , mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere .
they be most likely to occur if there be little democratic control on cash flow .
via the structural fund , a great deal of the European budget be be pump around the system .
this be only useful a long a there be a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States .
but there be also fund which be be pump via Brussels back to the same rich Member States .
district and regional authority consider this a their own money but they can only get their hand on this by invest vast amount of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating .
after each incident of improper use of this money , and certainly after fraud , the call for stricter control be more pronounced .
even the strictest control can not solve this problem .
it will , at best , lead to more bureaucracy and le room for local democracy and for people to get involve in choose and develop project .
it would be preferable if national government channel this money directly to their local government without a European detour .
in the next couple of year , we will need to think about the possibility of replace structural fund by an equalisation fund which be limit to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent region with a low income per caput of the population .
this be probably the only way to achieve le fraud , le overhead , more transparency and more democracy .
Mr President , a year have not yet pass , but it be already clear that Parliament be go to evaluate the first and second report differently .
it be of no concern to the major group in Parliament , nor to the majority of the trade union , who be busy discuss the defence of European public administration , but , in practice , be occupy with the corporate protection of their own member , put the wide power afford to them to dubious use .
trade union representative sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee , thereby make it impossible to remove disloyal official and preserve the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state .
incomprehensibly , trade union representative be also member of committee on competition , and I would not be surprise if union member be already member of OLAF , thereby place this institution which should , at least formally , guarantee it impartiality , at great risk .
I therefore understand why we be meet at this time , which be usually set aside for other activity and not for debate , discussion and the exchange of information .
Mr President , when it come to put it own house in order , the European Commission be in a Catch-22 situation .
there be enormous pressure of expectation follow the event that lead to the resignation of the previous Commission .
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposal make here in this Chamber sound , the more applause they receive .
there again , it be simply not possible to change situation once and for all with a few stroke of the pen , and the problem begin a soon a we have to start talk about implementation and get down to brass tack .
this may explain why we experience more difficulty than anticipate in the Committee on Budgetary Control a regard this issue .
nevertheless , the outcome be now on the table and there for all to see , and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he have do on this report .
provide this report be not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendment , it will afford u the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demand of the Commission on a number of crucial point .
allow me to start with the most important demand .
we do not want financial control to be abolish .
the financial controller should still be able to make check before fund commitment or payment be make , not in every case , but wherever uncertainty or risk arise .
the Commission be send out the wrong signal here , by rename the Directorate-General for Financial Control a the Directorate-General for Audits , for example .
it may well be easy enough to change the Commission & apos ; s organisation chart but it be a different matter when it come to the legal text , particularly those relate to budgetary discipline .
I do not have exact figure , but the Community & apos ; s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provision apply to almost 100 different area of responsibility of the financial controller , to his or her independence and the task assign to this office .
this can not be ignore or evade , certainly not on account of soft law , a be once suggest at a meeting of our Committee .
irrespective of such legal consideration , it would be an unforgivable mistake , under the circumstance , to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matter in the Commission be , at long last , no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of function supervisory and investigatory mechanism .
a we see it , there will be a dovetailing of three mechanism in the future : a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller , concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also know a the audit service - which have yet to be set up , and finally , there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularity by OLAF , the new anti-fraud office .
it be to be welcome that Mr van Hulten & apos ; s report make the connection between all three area and also make it clear a to where the crucial shortcoming lie , which must be tackle .
a few salient point : the disciplinary procedure be not take effect , especially when it come to call official to account for their misdemeanour , include those of a financial nature .
there be a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanction be concern , and it be precisely in this area that the announcement make by the Commission be rather vague .
I can only emphasise that these be the really hard nut that finally need to be crack .
Mr President , firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulation to my colleague , Mr van Hulten .
it be a good feeling to be able to say that he be from our delegation and I be , I think , entitle to feel a little proud of him .
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report .
Mr President , the Commission & apos ; s resignation have also create a culture of fear amongst many official within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy .
the call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seem to me a very fundamental one .
a lack of responsibility , too much ex ante , not enough ex post and , a a result , far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending .
it would be marvellous if this report be to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind , with all the work organise on that basis .
when the Commission & apos ; s first draft report soon become the official report on 1 March , I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change .
without any doubt , this will then be a service , Mr President , to the European public and , by mean of the result we produce , we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lose over the past couple of year .
this be the best support we can give to European democracy .
if , in this way , we can move away from the culture of the fifty and cross over into the next century , we be witness a very special moment indeed .
Mr President , first of all , congratulation to Michiel van Hulten for his first report .
it be a baptism of fire but we have a say in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion : in at the deep end and you will swim in no time .
Mr van Hulten , I think you deserve a medal for your effort .
there be two point which , in my opinion , deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR .
firstly , there be the Commissioners & apos ; individual responsibility .
this must be regulate during the IGC .
however , we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hand of the Council and we have , therefore , submit an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reach between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and be not place our fate completely in the hand of the Council .
secondly , a already mention by my colleague , Mr Mulder , the ELDR be of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigate by independent expert .
this will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizen in this institution .
we at the European Parliament can not be a credible counterpart to this reform Commission a long a we do not search our heart and put our own House in order a well .
only when all European institution be reform will we have the open , democratic and decisive Europe which our citizen now finally deserve .
Mr President , I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he be present to the House .
I be sure that it will serve , amongst other thing , to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up effort to find a consensus amongst the group .
at this stage , there can be no delay in the process of reform the Commission , demand by our citizen .
this Parliament have often hear the desire to reform the Commission express , even by it Presidents .
it now appear that this desire be more serious .
after the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts have list an almost endless number of deficiency , it make sense that Mr Prodi should have promise , on 14 September , to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February .
this Parliament anxiously await this complete reform programme .
the report that we be debate today intend to give political force to many of the recommendation of the Committee of Experts commission by this Parliament .
Mr Prodi say he would act anyway , that he prefer to get thing right , but that fear of not get thing right would not prevent him from act .
we therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and , if it be , I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process .
we want a strong Commission , which can act in an independent and neutral manner , but with political sense .
Commissioners should not be consider senior official but rather politician in office .
therefore , the report allow them to be member of political party and to be member of political body affiliate to their party .
perhaps the reference to the post be imprecise .
I do not know your exact view in this respect , Mr Kinnock , but it be clear that we want Commissioners who be politically strong and politically commit .
we want a structure which allow every Euro to be spend effectively , and our account demonstrate that this be not happen at present .
therefore , Commissioner , we ask Mr Prodi to present u with a bold programme , and he will find that he have problem with those body who feel that their status quo be under threat , but not with this Parliament , which expect profound and daring change .
Mr President , the Santer Commission come to grief because financial control fail all down the line .
therefore , the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reform be swiftly undertake here and financial control be back in work order .
a far a this be concern , a number of people have already refer to the fact that the Commission intend to drastically improve and consolidate it follow-up check and that these check should be carry out on a completely independent basis , with no sweeping of matter under the carpet in future .
naturally , this be only to be welcome .
what I do not understand be why this have to come at a price , a it be , that be , of have to dispense with independent - and I stress , independent - prior approval .
up until now , the Commission & apos ; s payment could only be make when the authorise officer sign the appropriate order and the financial controller give his approval in the form of a visa .
and so it be the & quot ; two key & quot ; principle that apply here .
a single key be to suffice in future .
the financial controller be no longer to make advance check , if all go to plan a regard the reform currently under discussion within the Commission .
if you will pardon me for say so , Mr Kinnock , what you be propose be a little like abolish the police because they be unable to prevent crime .
what we really need to focus on , however , be make the check more effective .
this could be achieve by no longer insisting , in future , that the financial controller furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp .
it be precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up control nothing at all .
therefore , in future , prior approval should take place in a targeted manner , that be , only in case of uncertainty or risk .
the official responsible for financial control should be deploy on a decentralised basis , that be , in the operational Directorates-General , amongst those of their colleague that spend the money , so that they be immediately available when problem arise and so a to render the check le ponderous and time-consuming .
however , the financial controller must work independently .
that be the crucial difference between our plan and those of the Commission , when it talk in term of decentralisation .
it be obviously the Commission & apos ; s intention to make the financial control official subordinate to the individual Directorates-General , but this be precisely what we do not want .
surely we have learn this much from the event surround the Leonardo affair , when the internal examiner in the relevant Directorate-General issue warning , but these be neither heed nor pass on .
therefore , independence be prerequisite for effective check .
that be the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribe to .
indeed , the new Commission have now declare itself in favour of follow-up check have this independence , and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence a well ?
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow & apos ; s vote .
Mrs Theato have already express a much and I be only too willing to support her in this regard .
Mr President , a couple of year ago , the previous Commission try once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structure .
this lead to strike and smear campaign by intransigent trade union , whereupon the proposal be abandon and replace by a wishy-washy compromise .
this be stupid of the old Commission , and Parliament be of no help on that occasion .
when I read Mr van Hulten & apos ; s passage about personnel policy , I be afraid that Parliament may again be fail to tackle the crucial issue and just spout a lot of hot air .
there be too many right , too many regulation and too little room for leadership .
there be no backbone , and no teeth .
where be the beef ?
and I would also say this to you , Commissioner : please , deliver the beef even if it be British .
Romano Prodi promise a revolution .
you have say some powerful and worthwhile thing yourself , but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issue , the one where it hurt !
sort out the tangle of staff allowance .
stand firm on the demand for mobility , not a a right , a it say here in the report , but a a management tool .
ensure too , that train become a management tool .
do not listen to the report & apos ; s demand that temporary staff should have their employment confirm .
it be the post which should possibly be make permanent and not necessarily those employ on a temporary basis .
finally , Mr President , a a member of the Bureau until six month ago , I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply , in our own administration , with the demand we be make on others .
we have not do this so far , and this be something you ought to be instrumental in change .
Mr President , I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I vote for it .
so I refer to the thing I do not agree with .
I do not agree with the paragraph in relation to Parliament .
this report be about the Commission .
Parliament be a separate subject .
there be no need for u to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission .
in addition to that , there be the question of duty-free .
that be a stick use to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobby who resent the fact that the Commission abolish duty-free in airport .
it be not worthy of be bring into this report either .
most of the report be about financial control .
that be reasonable because it come from the Budgetary Control Committee .
but we should not create the impression that vast amount of European resource be be put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission .
after all , it be only 1 % of GDP , by comparison with national spending .
we have have all that before but some people in this Parliament be young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resource of the European Union be and that 80 % of these resource be spend by the Member States .
so carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money be not likely to put at risk vast quantity of money .
we should get it into perspective .
it be important to remember that .
the business of the European Commission be very little about spend money .
they have very little of it .
they have a much wider responsibility .
that wider responsibility concern the management of the environment , food safety , foreign trade , the internal market and so many other responsibility we have give them without the resource to deal with them .
I be not one of the people who agree that there be a vast lack of trust .
if there be , we have generate it in this House in the past year .
I have be here for 20 year and find absolute trust between the Council , the Commission and Parliament .
we have have our problem and we recognise difficulty but there be not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission be mistrust , doubt and fear by the citizen of the European Union because they be mismanage our affair .
that be a gross exaggeration of what the difficulty be .
this Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistake that cause the resignation of the Commission that go before it .
while there be problem - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement , for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far .
Mr President , I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report .
I hope that the Commission will use it in it reform work .
the process of reform have be go on for some time , and something like a state of emergency seem to prevail in the Commission .
the Commission & apos ; s administration simply do not function particularly well .
naturally , there be good , capable employee in the Commission , and they be in the majority.But we need radical reform .
there be too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy .
people should have clearly-defined power to take decision for which they should also be accountable .
the Financial Regulation should be amend .
we agree that we should have better control of the finance .
it be just a question of how .
the Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts be in favour of completely do away with ex ante financial control .
we should be careful about this .
we should retain some form of ex ante financial control .
it be not enough simply to carry out spot check once the money have be spend .
this would allow too many anomalous project to slip through .
instead , we should be reform and decentralise control .
the Commission do not have enough staff .
a Members of the European Parliament , we must have the courage to explain to our government and people back home that the Commission & apos ; s staff resource be not at all adequate for the task which have be assign to it .
and the Commission should be able to refuse new task if it do not also get the extra staff it need .
the staffing system be too rigid .
there should be a more frequent rotation of employee , especially at the top of the hierarchy .
it should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employee .
I be therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure be to be reform .
after all , the very bad experience so far with disciplinary proceeding show all too clearly how necessary it be that we carry out reform .
Mr President , Commissioners , first of all , I can not help but reflect upon the fact that this be , on the whole , a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speaker be concern .
perhaps this be a little worrying .
I hope , like so many others , that the state of emergency in relation between the Commission and Parliament be on the way to be resolve .
we must get away from the idea that we be rush to put out a fire in one corner , only then to have to rush again to put out the next one.As Mr Blak say , we must instead establish a system with clear role .
first of all , we need tough regulation , which can be implement .
code of conduct and ethical committee be not enough .
there need to be tough rule state , among other thing , what may be decentralise , what may be outsource and what be independent .
I find it a little worrying that people be clamour for independence in this debate without define what it be in relation to which there be to be independence and without define what right of decision-making be to be exercise .
what we need , then , be basic administrative regulation for the EU , for it institution and for the EU in it relation with the Member States .
these be what be miss .
we have ask for a Public Prosecutor & apos ; s Office and criminal law , but we also need administrative law for the EU .
we should make a good deal of progress if the Commission be to adopt , a binding regulation , the ombudsman & apos ; s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice .
the van Hulten report be a step in the right direction , but it be not enough .
secondly , we must also clarify our own auditing role .
the Court of Auditors be to monitor the extent to which action be incompatible with the regulation , but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action .
it be the European Parliament which be to carry out the political evaluation .
we do not hunt down criminals.That be OLAF & apos ; s job .
tell me what national parliament , for example , be hand all preliminary investigation document .
Obstinate a I be , I also want to say that the regulation govern public access to official record must be clearly better than the draft which have be circulate on the Internet.Otherwise , we shall not get anywhere in this fight .
Mr President , I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report .
I be pleased that I can address him now in Dutch , now that Mr Van den Berg have just do so.Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this .
I would like to say that this report represent a huge improvement , also with it amendment .
I be from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee be always proud to receive 100 amendment because then they know that they have table an interesting topic .
I think that this be also the case here , but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talk about these 100 amendment .
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee be Mr Pomés Ruiz , who be Spanish and have hence make a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective .
Mr President , one of the key aspect which have be mention be , to my mind , the rapporteur & apos ; s proposal for the stand committee on standard in public administration .
a very important proposal indeed .
I be only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one table by Mrs Morgan , because she want to scrap it altogether .
I can not fully grasp the underlying rationale .
on the one hand , we receive all kind of word of praise for the rapporteur but , at the same time , Mrs Morgan want to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key point a well , a a result of which , in fact , the entire content of this report vanishes .
I do not know whether this be to appease Mr Kinnock , but I happen to know Mr Kinnock .
he be happy to hear what our demand be and be quite prepared to be flexible if he consider it necessary .
in my opinion , such a far-reaching scorched earth policy be really unnecessary .
finally , the issue of official .
actually , I do not entirely share Mr Haarder & apos ; s view .
I do agree that the section on official have , in fact , be complete totally inadequately .
first of all , the importance of a public service in general be not at all emphasised.Secondly , all kind of proposal be nevertheless be moot , and we have to ask ourselves whether these be terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement .
for example , we be currently look into TAOs.This be a key point but , at the same time , we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission .
these two consideration be diametrically oppose to each other , and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table .
Mr President , ever since Plato & apos ; s & apos ; Republic & apos ; , the Western world have regularly be tempt to replace government by the people with government by expert .
our Parliament first ask expert to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they take advantage of this invitation to determine , themselves , what it future should be .
in this second report , the expert have go a step further and criticise some of the political group in Parliament , which may have hesitate to remove the European Commission from office , since they share the political affiliation of some of it member .
the expert think that this problem will be resolve by ban the Commissioners from belong to political group .
accord to the expert , Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission.This task should be take over by a committee which will guarantee high standard in public life , and this should be a standing committee , not elect , presumably make up of another group of expert .
this lesson in wisdom be 100 % ideology and 0 % knowledge .
this will not help u to reform the European institution whilst fully respect democratic institution .
the van Hulten report start out a a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieve .
unfortunately , it be then change , and change for the worse , which turn it into a document which in fact , propose something that we can not accept .
Mr President , Mr van Hulten , your work be worthy of be qualify a enterprising , arduous and complex , and I believe this be important in a first report .
please therefore accept what I be about to say a be criticism make in the spirit of honest debate , and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer .
this report seem to me to be redundant , long-winded , confused and lack in accuracy in the term use .
perhaps & apos ; redundant & apos ; be the most serious epithet , and you be not responsible for this.It be the responsibility of this Parliament .
that be to say , if this Parliament commission a Committee of Experts - and I be not go to repeat what Mr Casaca have say , but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem , where be the sense in indulge in the medieval tradition of criticise the critic and so on , ad infinitum .
clearly we be await this reform from the Commission , we be await the proposal which the Commission be go to make to u and this Parliament will have to express it opinion on them .
meanwhile , we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence .
& apos ; Long-winded & apos ; .
I be not go to mention the length of this report .
I do not know if it break the record for all the resolution present here , but , for this type of resolution it certainly do .
I do not believe that there have ever be a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolution - which have have paragraph of more than 16 line without a single full stop .
it be also & apos ; confuse & apos ; .
I be not go to return to what have be say about the analysis of question concern Parliament .
that should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue , but not in this report .
and finally , Mr President , frankly , I be not go to give example , but there be many case in which legal language be use with an alarm lack of accuracy .
therefore - in summary - I await , and many of u await , your report , Commissioner Kinnock , so that we can really express our opinion on it , which be the duty of this Parliament .
Mr President , the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposal for necessary reform measure show just how important these reform be .
when one consider the event that have set these endeavour in motion though , it be only too clear a to why there be a need for them .
hope and expectation be raise higher still by the strong message send out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
the concept of transparency stand out in the report .
secure this be a major priority .
the importance of smooth-running , comprehensible work can not possibly be emphasise enough .
this be not just about bureaucratic reform , however ; rather , it be about show good will towards the citizen .
we must win back their faith in EU politics .
the citizen demand rapid and open access to the institution and call for EU provision to be comprehensible to them .
this be what enable them to understand what be go on .
they want to see the politics of success and believe that this be how any politically mature citizen could expect to be serve
whether or not the reform succeed depends , to a very large extent , on the Commission & apos ; s own initiative .
however , it annoy me when I hear today that the Commission be now say that it only wish to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis .
I believe , Mr Kinnock , that notwithstanding all the success achieve on a personal level , the Commission still have quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectation .
can I begin by state for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal response on the report be not mine and not the Commission & apos ; s - it be the decision of this Parliament !
so if she have any lecture to offer they be best contain within this House .
she know me well enough to understand that at all stage in the five year in which we work together in this House , there have never be a single occasion on which I have refuse to account in full , formally and in detail for everything I have do .
Mr President , may I begin by pay tribute to the painstaking and , from what I hear , the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in prepare his report .
although new to this House he be relatively old in some respect , certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions a a former official - and I think that the value of that be show by his ability to tackle the complex subject which be of critical importance , a several Members have say , to all of our Institutions .
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career a a representative .
Mr President , a you will know , Mr van Hulten & apos ; s report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts be necessarily long and , since I want to make a comprehensive reply , particularly on the issue relate to financial management and control , I seek your indulgence .
naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than be absolutely necessary .
when this House consider the second report of the Committee of Experts last September , I pledge on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treat a a fundamental ingredient in the Commission & apos ; s reform proposal .
our effort to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration be give to the reform package that be adopt by the Commission today , well within the demand timetable that we set for ourselves four month ago .
I be sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz be encourage by that .
the great majority of the paper & apos ; s proposal be closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper include - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of action to be undertake in pursuit of reform .
there be nothing therefore that be open-ended or vague about the report which I have have the honour to compile .
the consider view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five week will for obvious reason be of great significance .
I would say to Mr Elles that we be most definitely in listen mode .
but he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I be sure - that for u to be able to listen to the response to what we be propose , it be first necessary to transmit what we be propose .
hence the transmission .
though time forbids me , Mr President , from comment in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House , I readily give the assurance that the detail will be treat a an important input into our reform proposal throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant area .
turn to the main theme of the resolution I offer the following observation .
the need for transparency be rightly stress , not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operate will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission do .
this be essential for an executive administration that must be accountable , not just to this House , but more generally to the European public .
naturally , sensible safeguard be require to protect specially sensitive information , but the case where these be need should be keep to the minimum possible .
I have repeatedly emphasise that , indeed not just a a Commissioner , but in 25 or 30 year of campaigning .
that most certainly be the intention of the Commission .
financial management and control be obviously a crucial area of reform .
a the House know and have repeatedly say , the scale and scope of the Union & apos ; s financial intervention have grow immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staff or an adjustment in procedure .
several Members have make that point again in the course of today & apos ; s debate .
we share the view , forcefully express by the Committee of Independent Experts , and repeat in this draft resolution that the time have come for a thorough overhaul of our rule and procedure .
the mean of do that be set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present it proposal for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April .
parliamentary support in pursue that essential course for change will be absolutely vital .
I share the view express by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for u to seek to operate new arrangement without a change in the law .
change in the law be fundamental .
there be preparation which can be make and they be specify and set out with the full reassurance in the reform strategy , but enactment of change in the legislation be obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system .
essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control system within spending department so that Directors-General be better equipped to take responsibility for decision with an impact on the European Union budget .
in addition , and to achieve better assurance than those provide under the present system , the new system of decentralised control must be complement by set up an internal audit service - & quot ; the second key & quot ; a Herr Bösch say , establish in a way that be closely consistent with the recommendation of the Committee of Experts .
that service will open on 1 May this year .
it will be head by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and it independence must and will be guarantee through a new provision to be add in the financial regulation .
the new service will report to me and it will be accompany by an Audit Progress Board chair by my colleague , Mrs Schreyer , who I be delighted to see in the Chamber this evening .
a Budgets Commissioner , here responsibility already include relation with the Court of Auditors .
this Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audit .
I want to emphasise strongly that change our control system will definitely not mean relax them .
the propose change will make the system more effective , both in term of input and in term of measure and accountable outcome .
I can also specifically assure the House that we be not go for what be sometimes call & quot ; a big bang approach & quot ; .
financial control & apos ; s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquish a and when the internal control system in a department be show to be fully adequate .
I be somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution do not appear to address the fundamental criticism of the current centralised financial control function make in both report of the Committee of Independent Experts .
that committee be very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa .
it be clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control .
in addition , I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflect the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997 .
naturally the Court will be able to give it consider opinion on the propose change to the Financial Regulation but it be useful to recall Mr Karlsson & apos ; s comment to this House last month . & quot ; the Commission & apos ; s internal control & quot ; he say & quot ; be not forceful enough in prevent incorrect operation .
for instance , the Financial Controller grant a positive a priori visa in most of the case of mismanagement or irregularity recently uncover .
at the same time , the internal audit function be carry out in an uncoordinated way by several body , notably the same Financial Controller , the Inspectorate General and by some unit operate Directorates-General . & quot ;
the centralised ex ante approval system be doubtlessly originally design to ensure carefulness but , over the year , it have have the perverse effect of reduce the extent to which manager feel responsible for their decision .
I do not believe that there be any real disagreement between u on this .
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members be that there should be a carefully manage transition .
that will most certainly be the character of the change a honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document .
our objective , the committee & apos ; s objective , the Court of Auditors & apos ; objective be not to abolish financial control , it be to get rid of and improve upon centralise financial control .
before leave this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the exist internal audit function must be maintain pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of month .
turn quickly to the section of the resolution on fight fraud , corruption , mismanagement and nepotism : the major new proposal of the report concern report by Commission official of perceived wrong-doing .
a I make clear in the hearing last September and on other occasion , we be at one in the belief that there be value in define the best possible mechanism for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be need .
since June of last year , the OLAF regulation have give better guidance to staff about report possible irregularity .
we propose to complement those provision by define the right and obligation for official to report suspect wrong-doing through internal channel but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line .
the possibility of use specified external channel will also be address .
we be seek to implement best practice .
serious response to report , confidentiality at early stage and career protection will be assure for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in way that do not compromise investigation by untimely disclosure .
a a corollary , there will be safeguard for official who be the subject of false allegation .
a communication later this year will give full detail .
I do not think Parliament will be disappoint by what we will propose .
I be persuade , however , by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on use external body to enforce exist provision on financial liability .
we already plan to reform the exist disciplinary procedure to ensure thoroughness , fairness , consistency and professionalism .
and we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament .
a communication in June will set out the full proposal for change .
standard in public life be the next main section of the report before the House .
with the introduction of a series of code of conduct the current Commission have begin to develop an explicit ethical framework .
this will be take a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standard in public life .
that be in line with the draft resolution .
an important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethic and standard and to supervise common and separate code of conduct for the institution .
I welcome Parliament & apos ; s support for that .
we be also currently examine how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for document , make in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten & apos ; s report .
the draft resolution rightly recall the Commission & apos ; s accountability to this Parliament .
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleague have demonstrate the Commission & apos ; s practical commitment to that .
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relation between our institution which will include updated rule on access to document .
the point be very properly raise by Mr Elles and refer to by Mrs Thors .
I be sure they be aware that in mid-December we officially receive the draft framework agreement with Parliament .
we be now wait for Parliament to decide when it wish to begin negotiation on the text .
we be very happy to proceed a rapidly a possible .
the report rightly emphasise the central importance that human resource policy must have in reform .
I be glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendation on recruitment , training , appraisal and the appointment to management position be very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposal .
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system be no longer adapt to the need of our institution .
it certainly block the advance and mobility of people with proven capability .
Members , who , in the course of this debate , have properly praise Commission official , who in the great majority and typically be of high integrity , hard-working and of great capability , be absolutely right in the comment that they have make .
while the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our idea on these and other point , detail and precision be obviously essential .
a series of communication will therefore follow in the coming month .
each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House .
it be , meanwhile , very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament , a an institution , on central matter of common interest , notably pay and pension and the revision of the staff regulation .
on this latter point we be reflect on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which make common provision on lead issue like pay , condition , staff representation right and so on , but enable the different institution to operate implementing rule on other matter .
the early thought of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome .
I conclude by refer to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirement of our policy for change .
that be most certainly relevant .
we be sure that there will be an important & quot ; reform dividend & quot ; a the modernisation measure begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resource .
it be very clear , however , that part of the Commission service be already very stretched .
Parliament have frequently make that point .
secondly , it be also clear that reform will require some new investment in train for skill and in technology .
thirdly , it be very clear that increase preparation for enlargement must be undertake .
they be already have implication for resource availability .
it be also clear that if we take on new task - which we will surely be ask to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called & quot ; negative priority & quot ; and drop those negative priority in order to create spare capacity .
a central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tie the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management .
I want to emphasise , however , that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduce by the Commission , it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demand make on the Commission .
the Commission therefore welcome paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten & apos ; s report .
I conclude , Mr President , by thank the House for it attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by express sincere gratitude to the rapporteur , to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committee which give their opinion .
we look forward to work closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then , most important of all , work together with this House on it implementation continually through the year that will be require on such complexity .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
( the sitting be close at 11.15 p.m . )
Middle East peace process ( continuation )
the next item be the continuation of the Council and Commission statement on the Middle East peace process .
I be very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement this morning on the Middle East at the beginning of this debate and for hear some of Minister Gama & apos ; s insight , a he arrive hot-foot from the region .
such be life .
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I be not able to stay to the end of the debate a I would , in all normal circumstance , wish to do .
the debate be fix for this morning and on that basis I have arrange to see visitor from the Balkans this evening .
so I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion .
it be not something , I assure you , which I would wish to make a practice of .
like honourable Members , I welcome the United States & apos ; effort that have relaunched the Syrian / Israeli negotiation , despite the Syrian decision that they need more time before resume the talk that be schedule to start again today .
there be reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be build in the near future.I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese / Israeli talk which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel & apos ; s relation with it northern neighbour .
at the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track .
the situation of the Palestinians have always be the core issue of the conflict .
a fair and , indeed , generous deal with them remain the key to last peace in the Middle East .
Israelis and Palestinians have make substantial progress in implement the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum .
although there have be some slippage , I trust that the remain Israeli troop redeployment will materialise soon .
similarly , despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status have be push beyond the mid-February deadline , I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reach .
I be reassure that this be also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat , when they meet on Monday .
honourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours have be that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track .
this be far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible , in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsors a well a the regional party .
we be charge with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development .
the beginning of the talk with Syria pave the way for a convening of the multilateral steer group in Moscow at the end of the month .
I look forward to attend that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push thing forward again .
the European Union have an important role to play in the peace process , a all side - Palestinians , Israelis , their Arab neighbour and the United States - have acknowledge .
nor be our role confine to that of banker .
we must be prepare to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region .
but we should not kid ourselves : a comprehensive Middle East peace deal come with a hefty price tag .
the Commission be already consider the implication for the European Union of the recent encouraging development .
we intend to share our more detailed thought on the matter with Parliament and Council soon .
but let me remind honourable Members that the European Union be no slouch when it come to financial support for the peace process .
we be the largest of all donor to the Palestinians .
we have also offer very substantial support to Jordan , Lebanon , Syria and Egypt .
with the Israelis we have establish closer cooperation in a number of area of particular interest to them .
the Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grant and loan between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpin the Palestinian authority and contribute substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza .
European Union Member States together contribute another EUR 860 million during that crucial period .
in this context , let me applaud the important step that the Palestinian authority have recently take to improve budgetary transparency .
President Arafat will be meet the Council of Ministers next week .
this will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous step to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law .
the Commission be actively involve in those effort .
the Commission have also step up it planned support for regional cooperation project between Israelis and Arabs .
we commit more than EUR 20 million for such project last year .
this package include renew assistance for people-to-people activity and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert level .
Members will recall that the European Union be the largest financial donor to the overall effort in bring reconciliation to the people of the Middle East .
a number of issue naturally emerge a additional potential target of Community support in the come phase of the peace process - among them , help to consolidate a Golan settlement both in term of contribute to security arrangement and support demining and the rebuilding of community in the Golan Heights .
Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy .
reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon , the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict , will also demand considerable efforts.We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon a a whole .
a solution be need to the Palestinian refugee problem - these be the largest group of refugee in the world , number nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenge ahead .
we must support initiative increase the availability and improve the distribution and management of the region & apos ; s very scarce water resource .
lastly , but maybe most importantly , we be encourage closer regional cooperation in a number of area , bring all the country concern together in a joint endeavour to address their common problem .
it be already apparent that the financial resource currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be require in the event of permanent peace .
I want to underline that point .
I wish insistently to remind the Council and , should it be necessary , Parliament , that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we be actually capable of do .
I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be ask and expect to provide.I hope I can add that we will want to provide that .
we have make progress in recent month and week , a Mr Gama mention earlier .
but it be inevitably go to be a tough process with difficulty and disappointment on the way .
we will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligation and challenge that will be create by that outcome .
lastly , I will repeat for some who have enter the Chamber in the last few minute , what I say at the outset of my remark : that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate , largely a a result of have assume that the debate be take place this morning and have fix a meeting on the Balkans for this evening .
I hope the House will understand that .
Mr President , Commissioner Patten have our understanding .
I would like to tell him that communication with Madrid be usually more fluid and , therefore , I hope to see him there soon .
the statement we have hear today on the Middle East peace process be very opportune at the moment because of the hurry tour which Minister Gama - whose absence from this debate I also regret - have make of the region , accompany by other Council representative .
the tone of the news in the medium on the recent event in the area could lead u to take a pessimistic view of the situation .
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation .
in this sense , I share Commissioner Patten & apos ; s positive attitude .
let me explain : it be true that the Israeli Government have delay the third hand-over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authority .
this be naturally on the condition that the delay do not exceed three week , a Prime Minister Barak have promise .
on the other hand , the decision to delay the second round of talk , initiate in Shepherdstown by the Syrian Arab Republic , be undoubtedly significant , but I be convince that the hope which be raise on 3 January in that town will not be dash .
Mr President , the fact that the different group in this Parliament be table a motion for a resolution , in this ever controversial debate , which be the result of a broad consensus , seem to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace process .
I would therefore like , equally firmly , to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve difference , which be still no doubt profound , between the party .
in my judgement , this constitute a guarantee to both side , both from a political and a financial point of view , of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in term of it contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for .
it be clear to everyone that this be essential to guarantee security in the area and to cooperate in the development which be need to heal the serious social difference which exist .
but this also serve to make a claim , on the part of the European Union , for a degree of political participation in the process which be consistent with it economic contribution - we do not have aspiration to be banker - and which will be suitably visible to the public .
there be absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contribute to this .
Mr President , I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account .
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo & apos ; s speech set here .
we in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process .
it be , of course , a peace process which be finally under way .
if we think of how the process be look a year ago , the difference between then and now be like that between night and day , despite difficulty and delay .
I want to emphasise four point .
first of all , the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contains , a everyone know , a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel & apos ; s commitments.This apply both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements .
while the negotiation on the final peace settlement have begin , I think it be important to keep the two process apart .
a lack of progress in the final status negotiation should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreement .
what we need to look out for in this context be how matter develop in connection with the harbour in Gaza , the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank , further release of political prisoner and implementation of the financial commitment .
the second point relate to Syria .
there , the border question be obviously central .
how negotiation be proceed there , we still do not know .
what be important , however , be that they have begin .
an important question in this context be the future distribution of water .
a thing be at present , the Golan Heights account for between a third and a sixth of Israel & apos ; s water supply .
the third aspect be the peace negotiation in Syria which be closely link to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon .
accord to UNIFIL , there be now concrete sign that Israel be prepare to withdraw , which be something we welcome .
there too , of course , outstanding matter in dispute be the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugee .
my last point concern the future Palestinian State .
this may be proclaim in the course of this year , with or without Israel & apos ; s support .
the Barak government have give to understand that it intend to conclude a peace agreement with a state a the other party .
even if negotiation be not complete by September of this year , there be nothing in the relevant treaty to prevent a Palestinian state from be proclaim after that date .
in this context , it be important for those of u who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be a Commissioner Patten say , namely a state subject to public control , and that it should be a democratic state .
this be something to which we all want to contribute .
Mr President , I would like to refer , firstly and above all , to the joint resolution which will be lay down to round off this debate.My Group have make a contribution to this resolution and , needle to say , approves of it .
more specifically , however , I would like to express our delight at the fact that , after such a long time , Israel and Syria be on speak term again to resolve their difference of opinion .
the recent negotiation be already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East .
it be , therefore , regrettable that these peace talk have be suspend for the time be .
indeed , both party will need to make huge effort .
last peace in the region can only be achieve by mean of an agreement which guarantee the security of the Israeli border , a well a Syria & apos ; s integrity .
it be also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relation and to establish constant dialogue .
in addition to the bilateral meeting with Syria , I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiation with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that , in the framework of economic and regional cooperation , a multilateral approach will appear possible .
nevertheless , it be still regrettable that the European Union , one of the most important financial donor , be still unable to play a major political role in the peace process .
this peace process in the Middle East be one of the priority of the European Union & apos ; s common foreign and security policy .
this be where Mr Solana , the High Representative to the Council , could come into his own .
the Commission and Member States also have to be encourage to support project which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nation in the region .
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation .
in this respect , we support Libya & apos ; s participation , provide that it recognise human right , renounces support for terrorist and fully support the peace process .
there be still , needle to say , many unresolved problem and unanswered question , also involve the Palestinians .
everyone know that the peace process be a protracted and difficult affair but we be convince that , with the necessary trust , perseverance and indispensable political will , our common goal , namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East , will be achieve .
Mr President , it be please that , despite certain delay and problem , the peace negotiation be go on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria .
the moment of truth be approach .
be Israel prepared to comply with the UN & apos ; s resolution and , in exchange for peace and security , hand back the Arab area which be conquer in 1967 ?
will Israel let Palestinian refugee return or be give compensation ?
will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan ?
will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and , therefore , reliable a a partner in peace ?
will Syria fully accept Israel & apos ; s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law ?
the fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lie with the occupy country , Israel , do not prevent the Arab partner from also have a considerable share of the responsibility .
peace in the Middle East concern u all , however .
it be therefore good that the EU should act a a godparent to the Palestinian state .
against this background , I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler & apos ; s extermination of the Jews be be hold , which be obviously a welcome initiative .
of 47 state invite from all corner of the world , not one of them , however , be an Arab state include in the EU & apos ; s Barcelona process .
this have be interpret a indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regard by Europeans a be similar to the Nazis & apos ; anti-Semitism , which of course be completely incorrect .
the Arab world & apos ; s criticism of Israel have be found upon the same sort of anti-colonialism a , for example , Algeria & apos ; s fight for freedom against France .
but today , Egypt , Jordan and Palestine have peace treaty with Israel .
I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten do not agree with me that it would have be only right and proper to have invite at least one Arab state to the holocaust conference in Stockholm .
Mr President , I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he have demonstrate of the difficulty inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union be take on to bring it to completion .
this be an exercise in sovereignty , and in democracy for each population and every individual , but to this end it be vital for all party in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and right , and to recognise the other a it partner and not a it subject to whom concession must be give .
I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question , but the same also apply to the territory which have be occupy in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982 .
Israel have to accept it responsibility , withdraw from the occupied territory and share it water resource but , at the same time , it have to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in term of economic and political relation with all the country in the area .
however , Israel be not the only country concern with security .
tree have be uproot , house be still be demolish and , above all , water supply have be reduce or refuse , especially in East Jerusalem , while the settlement continue and be grow constantly .
nevertheless , there be no doubt that with the election of the new government , positive step have be take : negotiation , at least , have resumed.But in the Middle East , there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state , if they can not move freely within their own territory .
all the international community have to do be implement Resolutions 332 , 248 , 245 and 194 .
we be concern by the deferment of the building of relation with Syria , a well a Mr Barak & apos ; s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el ­ -Sheikh agreement .
we feel it be extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiation which match it economic aid .
we can not be content with a role backstage.We must be lead protagonist while stay off a collision course with the United States , a Minister Gama say .
Mr President , firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comment here today , particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process , and for reaffirm that our role be not only that of & quot ; banker & quot ; for the entire operation .
I be deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talk between Israel and Syria have be suspend .
I very much hope that a compromise can be reach to overcome this so that the peace negotiation can be resume at a very early date .
nevertheless , we can not deny that some positive political progress have be make in the Middle East of late .
the fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister be recently sit around the same table in America for the first time in their respective history be an indication that old hatred and animosity can be overcome .
political leader must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East .
I know that if agreement can be reach between Syria and Israel , the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum .
the settler at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensate and there will have to be guarantee of security .
if Syria would be willing to offer concession on the security question then the prospect of a successful resolution to the Israel / Syria question might be promise .
on the issue of Palestine , I recognise that there be still some difficulty with regard to the implementation of some aspect of the Wye Agreement .
the key problem area at the moment include the difficulty of redeployment , a well a the transfer of territory .
the low level of release of Palestinian prisoner and the fact that the Israeli Government appear to intend halt implementation of build permit already grant , a well a not approve new one , pose further obstacle .
these issue have clearly be hold up progress on the permanent status negotiation , although , I believe , these talk will not be hold up indefinitely .
at present , the main difficulty in approach the negotiation seem to be that the Palestinians be insist that the border issue must be agree upon first , while the Israeli Government say that it should be settle only if a solution be reach on the issue of settlement and security .
currently , both side seem to have accept that nothing will be agree until everything be agree .
in conclusion , while other country in the Middle East have have reservation about the overall direction of the peace process , now that the Syrian Government have be bring into the peace process , Egypt and other country in the region be willing to move forward .
I sincerely hope that , in the interest of improve the safety and quality of life of the people live in the Middle East , all the key protagonist will move forward quickly , in the very near future , so a to reach an overall agreement on all the key matter which need to be resolve .
Mr President , the various motion for resolution table in Parliament more or le represent the situation in the Middle East .
there be those who be in favour of new agreement between Israel and Syria , but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue .
indeed , the time have come to resolve a central problem for global stability .
the time have come for Israel to fulfil it promise of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territory , at last recognising once and for all the authority of Palestine , whose resume diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it be under the wise leadership of Yasser Arafat .
it be equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question , which no one discuss anymore , thereby relegate the problem of million of woman , elderly people and child , the victim of an embargo a arrogant a it be wicked , to oblivion .
I do not know what Syria and Israel will want or be able to do in reality , but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it be time that it attach the same importance to people & apos ; live a it do to the ballast of the cold , colourless , artificial neon bulb in our lamp , which can illuminate house but not the world in the third millennium .
Mr President , the Israeli author , Amos Oz , manage to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiate table between the Israelis and Syrians recently .
he be under the impression that the Syrians think that , in exchange for the Golan Heights , all they have to do be to fax the Israelis a receipt .
Oz & apos ; s impression be also echo in the Israeli press .
it contrast Prime Minister Barak & apos ; s personal peace effort and the distant attitude , even physical absence , of the strong man of Damascus , President Assad , at the negotiation in the United States .
surely Assad would be Barak & apos ; s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister .
and the Israelis be certainly not impress by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown .
his behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak be plainly insulting .
but why pay attention to such detail a basic diplomatic nicety in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory ?
well , the Syrians be quite possibly cut off their nose to spite their face .
at the end of the day , Israeli voter can still express an opinion on the return of the Golan .
all the resolution submit express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process .
it be , however , very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billion of dollar which the Israeli and Syrian authority require from their peace patron , the United States , not to mention the heavy , equally costly , security guarantee in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan .
I would like to finish off by ask the European Council and Commission a question .
how accurate be the press report which state that the Portuguese Presidency have already pledge troop a a peacekeeping force in the Golan ?
Mr President , the truth be that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talk between Syria and Israel be not good news , but nor be it good news that the day before yesterday there be another bomb attack which injure 16 people .
the suspension of the talk between Syria and Israel be not the only delay affect the peace process in the Middle East .
the application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authority and Israel be also suspend at the moment .
after the talk which take place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority , the Israeli Prime Minister request a delay of two month a from 13 February , the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
what can the European Union do in these circumstance ?
unfortunately , very little .
it naturally have to support these negotiation , sponsor by the United States ; contact have to be increase ; the presence of the European Union envoy , Ambassador Moratinos , who have fulfil his mission with great diligence and efficiency , within the power of the European Union , be positive .
but none of this hide the fact that there be a certain sense of impotence , because when the negotiator from each side fly back to the United States this weekend , we will have to remember that , for every 100 dollar spend on the peace process in the region , 60 be contribute by the European Union .
when we consider that a conference will soon be hold in Moscow , it become clear that the European Union & apos ; s presence in this peace process be somewhat pitiful .
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role , that it be time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process .
I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region , a well a the president of the relevant interparliamentary delegation , will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the European Union in this complicate and difficult peace process .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner Patten , I should like to thank you for your statement , especially Commissioner Patten , whose analysis I fully share and I shall not , therefore , repeat any of his idea .
I should just like to make three comment which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see a similar but which , for various reason , a Member can formulate more openly .
first , I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authority .
but we have enough agreement now : Oslo , Wye Plantation , Sharm el-Sheikh .
we have enough agreement ; they just need to be implement .
however , in this regard I share Mr Salafranca & apos ; s scepticism when he say that there have be bad news from Israel this week , namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum can not be implement within the set timeframe .
my second point concern the resumption of negotiation between Syria and Israel .
I consider this to be very encouraging news .
but we have also learn this week that Mr Barak will not be travel to Washington and that the negotiation can not therefore be continue .
I should like to make it quite clear : if the Golan Heights be return to Syria , the problem in this region will be solve .
on the question of the referendum which various Members have refer to : we must consider if a referendum always need to be hold in order to honour obligation under international law and under the law of nation .
in Germany , there would probably be dance in the street if we be to say that we be hold a referendum on payment to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people be prepared to pay .
that would be a similar situation .
my third and last point concern the role of the European Union .
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos & apos ; special mission have play in the region and the funding which we have provide there , Commissioner Patten .
you know that you will always have our support here in Parliament , and that include your proposal , and we shall be behind you when the time come to finance it .
but we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos can not play that role in this region on his own ; the Presidency of the Council must take action , the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do a the Russians do and invite the protagonist of the peace process ourselves .
then we will have play the role which be commensurate with our participation and our contribution .
Mr President , Commissioner Patten , the recent peace talk begin in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East.It have take fifty year to reach this point , which will involve some particularly difficult negotiation .
there will be no meeting today in Shepherdstown but we must hope , a Mr Patten say just now , that this postponement of the negotiation due to Syrian requirement will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East .
this hope be contain in our motion for a resolution.We hope for a fair and balanced agreement base on respect for sovereignty and the right to live securely within safe and recognised border .
all the foreign troop , include therefore the Syrian force , must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 520 of the United Nations Security Council .
dare we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July 2000 , the date promise by Ehud Barak ?
dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and it neighbour to the north ?
we really hope and believe so .
never have the party be so determined .
one fundamental point to be stress be the balance which must be express in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people.There must also be a political balance between the participant in the negotiation .
follow the attack in Hadera on Monday , we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism .
in term of balance , or should I say imbalance , I must add that it be to be regret that Europe be still play a minor political role in resolve this conflict .
at midday , Mr Gama refer to the financial and commercial support provide by Europe to the region .
despite everything , we be be force to recognise that the resumption of the peace process be largely due to the work of Washington .
like other Arab country before them , the Syrians choose the Americans to sponsor the negotiation .
this be the choice also make by Israel where Europe suffer from a partisan public image , and this be a fact , not a judgement .
this be now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten , Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos how much we be rely on their effort to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict .
although it be difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process , it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity .
area of Freedom , Security and Justice
the next item be question to the Council ( B5-0040 / 99 ) and the Commission ( B5-0041 / 99 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens & apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom , security and justice ( Article 39 of the TEU ) .
Mr President , 1999 be the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , of the communitisation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extraordinary Tampere Council .
these have be the most important moment in the Council & apos ; s expression of it political will to establish an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union .
the Council have decide to draw up a charter of citizen & apos ; right - and we rejoice in this ; it have decide to implement Article 13 of the Treaty , combat all form of discrimination and xenophobia , and it have decide to approximate the law on condition for admission and residence , a well a guarantee resident treatment which be fair and on an equal footing with the citizen of the Union .
it have also reach a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposal for civil cooperation .
this have be the year in which policy on justice and home affair have be provide with a Community framework .
they have be put into the hand of a single Commissioner , Mr Antonio Vitorino , and we congratulate them on this a well .
furthermore , they have take on the task of create a & quot ; scoreboard & quot ; to verify the progress make in this area at Community level , but also - and this seem to me to be important - at the level of the Member States .
we be pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decision , despite the fact that , for this House , the Treaty of Amsterdam include one disappointment : that of delaying , for five year , our role , our ability to participate actively , to democratically control this area of freedom , security and justice , a well a the role take in it by the Court of Justice .
however , if , on verify the progress make during 1999 , which be within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty , we leave behind the stage of great declaration and look at the decision actually take and carry out , the scene look considerably darker , Mr President .
it be a if the Council have more than one face and two hand and what one sign up to , the other begrudges .
despite all the commitment make at the highest level , the Council do not manage to take the decision which it have envisage .
programme multiply and overlap and there be no way of ascertain level of implementation and effectiveness or , at least , this Parliament be unable to do so .
we have present the Council with a series of question and I know that it be the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them .
we hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament .
I say that there be no consistency between the decision take by the Council and the policy actually carry out .
there be doubt in my Group and doubt also persist in this House , for example , about something which should be good news : the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework .
Schengen have be incorporate , a we say earlier , into the acquis , but it have be do with very little transparency .
not a single piece of information , nor a single consultation , have be address to Parliament during this process ; neither on the association of the United Kingdom , nor on the incorporation of Greece , nor on the negotiation with Norway and Iceland .
the same be true with regard to immigration policy .
we have amuse ourselves with a pile of report , but we have no idea what have happen to these initiative ; they have disappear .
we hope that 2000 will be the year for action , in the same way that 1999 be the year for expectation .
we hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament .
the Council have decide that justice and home affair policy must form part of the structure of the Union .
the Council can act in accordance with Parliament & apos ; s decision , or it can continue to miserably begrudge it association with the other institution in this vitally important project .
if it choose the second approach , it must be aware that this present risk and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom , security and justice be build .
alternatively , it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institution , in order to move forward in another way .
fulfil your obligation to Parliament in a generous spirit , thus prepare for the future .
provide the Commission with the necessary resource and recognition essential for it to carry out it work and for it to verify the real progress make at Community level and at the level of the Member States , and we will be - and the Council will be - able to deal with the decision make at Tampere and move towards a Union which be freer , more just and more secure .
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , a I do not have a background a a Member of the European Parliament , you will understand that it be even more move for me to be here than it be for my colleague Fernando Gomes .
a Mrs Terrón i Cusí say in her speech , 1999 be a year of great expectation in the field of justice and home affair - an expectation realise with the come into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , an expectation realise with the conclusion of the Tampere Council , and a fundamental expectation , a from this year , that will be realise in the form of specific action .
we be all aware that , to this end , it be essential for the Council to approve , a quickly a possible , the scoreboard which Commissioner Vitorino have the remit of establish .
I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency & apos ; s earnest desire for political agreement to be reach on the scoreboard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March .
turn to the specific question that Mrs Terrón i Cusí have put to u , I shall group them into three basic area : the fight against organise crime , the operation of the Judicial Network , particularly a regard criminal matter , and question on Europol .
this be an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work , not just by secure approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organise crime in the new millennium , but also so a to overcome the difficulty associate with the divergence of view that exist , particularly at Council level , on issue concern the fight against organise crime .
with this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we be already establish with the French Presidency , with the aim of organise a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council .
if this be not to be a mere medium event , it will need to be carefully prepare by a joint committee , the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency have already propose .
our relation with third country represent another important aspect of the fight against organise crime .
another area be EU involvement in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and it various protocol , and in the convention be prepare in the framework of the Council of Europe , in particular on cyber crime .
a this be an issue which have become important in the justice and home affair programme , the presidency believe that it be worthwhile , bear in mind the principle of Chapter VI of the Treaty , to explore suitable mean of provide the European Parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiation under the United Nations Convention .
with regard to the Judicial Network , significant progress have be make , in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicate telecommunication system of the European Judicial Network , whilst the Multi-disciplinary Group have develop a series of action to implement the 1997 action plan .
however , we must stress that it be vital for approval to be give a soon a possible to the strategy for the new millennium , so a to give a fresh impetus , while preserve continuity , to the work do under the previous action plan .
still on judicial cooperation , considerable progress have be make on the legal protection of the euro , and the European Parliament be be consult on a framework decision which be of fundamental strategic importance .
we believe that if legal protection of the euro be to be credible , we must avoid have a multiplicity of instrument , and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument cover all necessary aspect , include those feature in initiative already present by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself have call for .
it be important in this field to implement measure relate to the mutual recognition of judicial decision , and we believe that on the basis of work already do , it will be possible , at least in the field of seizure of asset , for measure to be adopt in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decision .
the French Presidency have pass an important working document to u which set out various scenario for address and resolve the issue of democratic control and judicial control of Europol .
the Portuguese Presidency will shortly be present a working document on the Eurojust network , since although it be not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust , this option can not be rule out at present .
for this reason , it be essential that the Council & apos ; s debate on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conduct in parallel , so that conclusion can be reach in parallel also .
I believe that in this context , and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Europol and Eurojust , it will be possible for u to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the Council and Parliament with regard to Europol .
we be familiar with Parliament & apos ; s view and we know that Parliament be aware of the view of the Council & apos ; s legal adviser .
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question a part of the process of resolve the issue of democratic control of Europol , and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all party involve .
I would also like to thank Mrs Terrón i Cusí for have ask the question which have give rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice , and to thank all the Members who , in their various committee , have actively participate in prepare this annual debate.I would also like to thank the representative of the national parliament and of civil society .
in this first speech , I would like to share with Parliament the Commission & apos ; s view of the most important event in 1999 .
I believe that I can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 be both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the Union on issue of freedom , security and justice .
it have already be mention that the Treaty of Amsterdam come into force in May and this Parliament state that the most far-reaching innovation in this Treaty be it recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom , security and justice .
at the same time , it also represent a quantum leap in qualitative term , and a logical and vital step in the development of the Union , in the wake of the establishment of the internal market , the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy .
this project be not so much a project of the institution a a project of the citizen of our common Union .
and it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizen reside in the territory of the European Union , recognise that this be only meaningful if it be root in a secure base , with solid foundation in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access , on equal term , and in which our citizen can have real confidence .
the Union & apos ; s commitment to establish an area of freedom , security and justice be confirm at Tampere .
1999 be also mark by the German Presidency & apos ; s initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I believe that at the present stage in the European Union & apos ; s development , it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental right in force at European Union level in a charter , so a to make them a visible and accessible a possible to our citizen .
a I have already say on a number of occasion , I be in favour - the Commission be in favour - of draw up a charter which would reflect , on the broadest basis possible and a part of a dynamic process , the common constitutional tradition of the Member States and the general principle of Community law , rather than be a mere statement of the lowest common denominator .
in my capacity a a representative of the Commission , I will ensure that the charter and the action stem from it represent an affirmation of a Union base on a set of fundamental right which be an integral part of Europe & apos ; s common heritage .
that be the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European Union in the eye of every European citizen , an enlarge Europe base on respect for right and freedom , with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection , in other word , a Union root in the political value which underpin contemporary democracy .
I must not overlook the fact that 1999 mark the beginning of the 1999-2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament , that it be the year in which the new Commission take up it duty and , a a consequence , the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the area of justice and home affair assume his responsibility .
in addition to these event , I would like to remind Parliament of some item that be approve in 1999 .
we also present a communication on common procedure concern asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorise the Commission to open negotiation with Iceland and Norway on an agreement design to extend the rule apply by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two country .
the Commission make an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration , and ultimately , in December , it present a proposal aim at establish a European refugee fund .
in 1999 , we also present a communication on victim of crime in the European Union , which lead to discussion that be give greater impetus at Tampere.This communication call for minimum standard for protect the victim of crime , in particular a regard their access to justice and their right to compensation , include the cost of justice .
we also present a proposal for a decision on combat fraud and forgery of non-cash mean of payment .
in the field of European Union legislation on combat financial crime , the Commission present a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering .
in 1999 , the Commission also present it contribution towards a European action plan to combat drug , which underpin the strategy approve by the Helsinki European Council .
for this reason , 2000 will no doubt be a year for test how the EU & apos ; s institution respond to our citizen & apos ; demand for guaranteed freedom of movement , with respect for their right and guarantee of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection .
in other word , 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundation for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council , for Parliament and for the Commission .
this scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning.It will also , and above all , be an instrument for increase transparency and increase the accountability of all the European Union & apos ; s institution towards the public .
it be for the public , therefore , that we be develop the area of freedom , security and justice .
the progress make will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council , nor even to the European Parliament , but to a combination of European institution and to the Member States themselves , in a much a - a have already be point out here - specific task on the scoreboard will be entrust to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity .
in the coming week , I shall be make a tour of capital to sound out the opinion of the various minister for justice and home affair .
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project .
and we hope , during the Portuguese Presidency , to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council , take account of the sounding that I have just mention .
it be my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument provide political and strategic guidance to all the institution , and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny .
for this reason , and I believe that this be a challenge we be all facing , I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow u to make the real add value which the Union bring to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in area which be essential for citizenship , for legality and , ultimately , for democracy itself .
in addition to the scoreboard , I would like to anticipate the following initiative that the Commission intend to present during 2000 - and I would like to emphasise that I be delight the Portuguese Presidency be treat progress in the area of freedom , security and justice a a priority in it work programme .
I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation , which be also the political message of Tampere , and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carry forward by subsequent presidency .
I also intend to contribute to the process of clarify the role of action plan a part of the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration , and to make progress in adapt Community agreement in the field of readmission by include standard clause .
furthermore , on the subject of cross the external border of Member States , which be a central issue regard the free movement of person , I shall , in the next few day , be present a proposal for a regulation update the list of third country whose national be require to hold visa for cross the external border .
turn to judicial cooperation , in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-contractual obligation , I sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for minimum standard ensure an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceeding .
I also intend to continue discussion on the preparation of specific common procedural rule for simplify and speed up cross-border judicial proceeding relate to small commercial and consumer claim , alimony claim and non-contested claim .
a a follow-up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusion , the Commission will be present it contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organised crime .
we will be organise and support action include , in particular , the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implement mutual recognition of judicial decision in criminal matter .
the Commission also intend to present specific measure in the field of crime prevention , so a to encourage exchange of best practice in this area , and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency ; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme finance by the Community for this purpose .
the Commission will also support the presidency & apos ; s effort to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering , an eminently cross-pillar issue .
we be also prepare a communication to instigate a debate on mean of ensure greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combat computer crime .
the year 2000 also mark the start of the implementation of the European Union Drugs Strategy 2000-2004 .
in this field the Commission , in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament , will give it full support to the Interinstitutional Conference to be hold on drug in February .
the recent restoring of certain internal border control lead me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the condition for adopt a legislative instrument base on Article 62 of the Treaty .
nevertheless , I must make it clear that all these action will , of course , have to take into account the principle agree at the Helsinki European Council concern applicant country , so that those applicant can cooperate and also be associate a quickly a possible with this project of create an area of freedom , security and justice .
furthermore , it be important to remember that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affair negotiation with the first group of applicant country and I anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in prepare the negotiate dossier on the second group with which it be agree to open accession negotiation at Helsinki .
lastly , I would like to state once again that the Commission intend to be in the pole position in present proposal for implement the Treaty of Amsterdam .
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective role in exercise their right to initiative and in carry forward the legislative process itself.As I have tell Parliament , the task before u be immense and ambitious , and the Commission need to have the necessary human resource to respond to this challenge .
Commissioner Vitorino , although I would describe cooperation with you a harmonious and profitable , word have often fail me in the past when face with the conduct which the Council have demonstrate towards u .
it look , a Mr Schulz once aptly say in committee , a if the Council understand the area of freedom , security and justice to mean an area in which the Council have free rein , security from Parliament and the right to do and order a it will .
Minister Gomes , I have , of course , hear what you have say and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency .
I should like to raise three point which for u , a Members of the PPE Group , must be focal point when such an area be create .
first : a common asylum law must be create and the burden of absorb refugee must be distribute .
the Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC be adopt in order to create the basic requirement for classify asylum seeker .
a far a a European asylum law be concern , a start be in fact make at Vienna and Tampere .
unfortunately , however , it have highlight the difficulty rather than propose solution .
I therefore call on the Council representative to look beyond their national boundary and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union .
similarly , it can not be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent .
agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda .
secondly : the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organise crime , include by Europol and Eurojust .
the planned introduction of Eurojust be one of our significant success from Tampere and must now be implement forthwith .
we welcome the fact that Europol have finally be able to start work .
however , the Council should also bear in mind that , if we be to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime , we do not only need to widen Europol & apos ; s remit , a decide at Tampere ; we also need to increase the number of officer and extend it remit to operational activity .
we be not just call for more control , and more control over Europol ; our motto here be & quot ; Less be sometimes more ! & quot ;
with most of Europol employee currently engage in self-control for the purpose of data protection law and question be ask by 15 national parliament , we may have a great deal of control , but it be inefficient control .
we want le confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament , without hamper the work of Europol .
at the same time , we support the establishment of a European police academy a suggest in Tampere a a step in the right direction .
thirdly : the extension to Parliament & apos ; s right in this context .
if the establishment of such an area , in which the Union can also intervene in the basic right of the citizen , be only decide by diplomat and bureaucrat , while the elected representative of Europe be reduce to follow development like a rabbit watch a snake , then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizen .
there be therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision right in this respect and , a we have already say , to strengthen the principle of democratic control .
we want an area of freedom , security and justice for the citizen of Europe , not against them .
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency be make justice and home affair one of it top priority or jewel in the crown .
I be also encourage by Commissioner Patten & apos ; s comment this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crisis .
perhaps that will end scandal like the failure of state to deploy in Kosovo the police they promise .
I just want to highlight three area among many where we need quick progress .
the first be asylum .
it be essential to establish a single European system , but one base on fairness , full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception condition , include an end to routine detention .
decision on asylum should take month - not year .
the second area be that of freedom : freedom to move and reside wherever one wish in the Union ; freedom of information ; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that include not just Member State citizen but third country national .
let our citizen know that our common policy in justice and home affair be about freedom , not just about repression .
the last area I want to mention be convergence of civil and criminal justice system .
Eurosceptics claim that this be a threat to sovereignty , the end of the nation-state , and so on.But the case of the suspect want for question in connection with the murder of three woman in France , include British student , Isabel Peake , who be throw off a train , show why we need mutual recognition .
arrest and release in Madrid , he be now be extradite after arrest in Lisbon .
whatever the Eurosceptics say , it be in all our interest to get cooperation in such matter .
finally , a have already be say , it be essential , and I hope that the IGC will cover this , to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these area , with democratic and judicial scrutiny .
Mr President , all I can say about 1999 be this : how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter .
I hope that it work out .
the Tampere Summit be certainly an important milestone in 1999 for Europe , and for the area of freedom , security and justice in particular .
numerous question be still outstanding .
answer be still await .
since Tampere , there have be an imbalance between positive action and mere declaration of intent .
regulation on nationality and the integration of people from third country be still outstanding .
on the other hand , quite specific action have be call for on the subject of safety of life .
the creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important project in the immediate future .
however , it be difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implement legally when you think of the people who be not currently citizen of the Union .
the Europol agreement have now officially enter into force .
in Tampere , the question of grant operational power be discuss .
we continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control .
the agreement also attract criticism with regard to EURODAC .
Parliament have amend the contractual text .
care must be take to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament & apos ; s modus operandi .
unfortunately , no initiative have yet materialise regard other matter and we still await them .
Europe a an area of freedom , security and justice have so far be an area with no clear regulation in important sector .
and yet we owe this to the citizen of Europe .
have listen to the justice and home affair minister , I be optimistic and I be assume that we will succeed in the next six month .
Mr President , Commissioner , the oral question table by Mrs Terrón i Cusí show that this House be take a firm stance.Indeed , six month after the election of this new Parliament , we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe .
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this .
we be all aware of the enormous expectation of our people with regard to freedom , security and justice , particularly social justice .
yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all thing political require u to take specific action to tackle their problem .
this be the sine qua non condition for reconcile the popular and political sphere .
for Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity , we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged .
a proper plan for fight unemployment must be establish for this be the scourge which be allow the rise of racism , xenophobia , nationalism and extreme-right racist movement .
we should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrant and refugee .
the virtually systematic condition of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers be no longer acceptable .
all asylum-seekers must be entitle to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect .
last week , and somewhat by chance , I witness , at Roissy airport , a scene of rare violence in which two young woman , admittedly illegal immigrant , be be return to Conakry .
they be treat like the worst criminal .
they be strip naked and drag along the floor by their hair , surround by a horde of state security police .
the Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour .
our role should be to accompany , reassure and assist those who be flee dictatorship .
the Commission have propose create a European fund for refugee to which Parliament be favourably dispose .
instead of all this waffle about the budget grant to this fund , we could take the decision to set this up .
the Presidency and the Council can realise what be incomprehensibly reject in Tampere , even though this summit provide an important basis .
likewise , we can not simply record the rise in xenophobic feeling in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without take wide-ranging action .
the law against racism must be harmonise .
what direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty ?
what do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wage for men and woman ?
how do you aim to eradicate homophobia , racism and sexism ?
we must take the best from each of our country .
when six European country have grant the right to vote , the President of this House can venture to extend this right to vote , and eligibility to participate in the municipal and European election , to all people from outside the Community who have live in Europe for more than five year .
the regularisation of illegal immigrant in certain country , include your own , must act a an example to others.These illegal immigrant nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlord , an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation , render them modern-day slave .
in more general term , this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority group and immigrant .
immigration be too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive response .
how do you intend to make our people understand that , today like always , immigration be a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which be , and will remain , essential in the context of population ?
what action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrant in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers ?
Mr President , there be a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice .
the European Union be an economic powerhouse but we be not in a position to pontificate when it come to our treatment of refugee .
the level of racism in our society be terrify .
Ireland , for generation , send her son and daughter to place of safety throughout the world , but now when the Celtic tiger be provide wealth and prosperity beyond our expectation , we be show a very ugly side to our character.Racism in Ireland be endemic .
it have be a relative shock to our political leader to find we must now take a share of the refugee that have be come into the European Union for a long time .
we be come from behind in deal with the issue and the government be do it utmost to catch up .
there be a willingness but fear pervades , and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union .
Mr President , we take note that the excuse-making , reticent Presidency , which , in recent month , have prevent u from hold a debate such a the one we have be able to hold today , have come to an end .
I totally agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Schulz & apos ; s remark , and truly believe that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice need to be more involve in the area of freedom , security and justice , without have to derogate from their own power .
nevertheless , to avoid the customary circus , which every six month have u indiscriminately attack the Presidency of the Council , maybe Parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five year .
the two identical-sounding question which be under discussion be , of course , underpin by a mantra of the kind which , in recent year , have increasingly transform politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding , but pernicious .
and our current EU mantra be AFSJ : area for Freedom , Security and Justice .
behind this lie another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House , namely to introduce such an area .
and who be not in favour of security , freedom and justice ?
the problem be just that this be not something the EU can introduce by mean of legislative decree and other supranational resolution .
freedom , security and justice be the root system of any society , reflect it history , corporate experience and political development .
a system of this kind be not something the EU can introduce without society & apos ; s sustain damage a a result .
but it be precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security , freedom and justice .
the agenda be not design to secure justice for the citizen .
that be already secure by mean of the various national legal system .
the agenda be design to transfer vital part of society & apos ; s criminal law , policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU & apos ; s control .
it be concern with increase integration which , a part of a duplicitous package , involve increase repression and control .
you just have to think of all the resolution concern Fort Europa , Schengen , Eurodac etc.Any democrat can spot two key problem .
first of all , the initiative which have be plan be completely unrealistic .
how be it envisage that the EU & apos ; s institution , which be already stretch well beyond their capacity , can bring the ambitious project concern to fruition ?
think of last year & apos ; s deadly criticism of the Commission & apos ; s lack of propriety , ethic and accountability .
it also , of course , find indirect expression in the question .
but , secondly , the project will put a strain on , indeed will be injurious to , the national democracy .
a long a the EU revolve around the internal market , only the body be be attacked.Now , it be the soul .
Mr President , today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony .
we have Commissioner Patten speak in this House in defence of freedom , security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon , which have be accept , will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and it reserve and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious section into the hand of the terrorist .
the IRA terrorist have not give up any of their weapon , nor have the loyalist terrorist , yet the police be be force into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community .
let me just look at the figure from the day that the agreement be sign .
in 1998 , we have 55 murder .
in 1999 , we have 7 murder and that do not include the Omagh bomb where 29 be kill and 300 injured .
between 1998 and 1999 , loyalists assault and shot 123 people , while republican assault and shot 93 people .
charge bring against loyalist in 1999 total 193 , while those against republican total 97 .
since January 2000 , there have be six shooting by loyalist and two by republican , loyalist have be involve in six serious assault , one lead to another murder , while republican have engage in five serious assault .
Mr President , that situation can not continue and need remedying .
Mr President , the Treaty of Amsterdam have set an important objective for the Union .
this be a task which all MEPs , the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature : the creation , a have be say already , of an area of freedom , security and justice .
the Tampere Council , the motor and architect of this objective , have propose certain goal , but five year , the time scale lay down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty , be too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problem require .
my first point be that Parliament must not be exclude from the important decision to be take in this area and that it participation in the decision-making process must be guarantee , especially with regard to this project which affect the citizen , a the Commissioner have explain very well .
my second point be that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system , adopt common procedural rule and , above all , put an end to the current confusion between migration for political reason and migration for economic reason .
the recent law on alien adopt in my country , Spain , and in Belgium , be a reminder that there be an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy .
my third and final point relate to the external activity of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum .
we must not and can not give the impression that the Union exclusively wish to defend itself from an avalanche of refugee and economic migrant .
we must opt for a policy of cooperate in the development of our neighbour country in the East and the Mediterranean area , but we must do so with rigour , with economic mean and in close collaboration with public institution , which must cooperate in the protection of those citizen whose most basic right be violate or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential need .
finally , in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the citizen of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship .
the Euro , employment , even security , be not enough .
they need a & apos ; European soul & apos ; , a a distinguished Spanish professor once say .
Mr President , unlike some of the previous speaker , I want to go back to the word of our Portuguese minister and Mr Vitorino .
this trio & apos ; s word be like music to our ear a Mr Ceyhun have say .
a with all music it need to be a fine tune and properly orchestrate .
many of u of here be very optimistic about the next six month .
the tune that will be play will be one that the people of Europe will be listen to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune .
a describe this afternoon it will go a long way towards drown out some of the unpleasant tune we hear during the European election and over the last few month .
the Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council build on this project for an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union .
one area though be extremely important , and this House must be involve in it : namely scrutiny .
there be so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that be outline to u last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it be scrutinise , that the people in this Parliament and the member of the national parliament and the citizen of Europe be aware of everything involve in it .
and we must make certain that the detail be applicable , appropriate and relevant to the different country .
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspect of the resolution before u this afternoon , one or two of which be refer to earlier on .
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial system in the various country and the cooperation on crime .
that be an area that European citizen will respond to and will be happy about .
but the Commission and Council must know that there be many people in this House who have reservation about the Eurodac system , for example .
we accept the predominant role of the Council in this , but there be reservation and I be sure that the Council will listen to the word come from the elect parliamentarian here when they go through it in more detail .
Mr Schulz say earlier on that he be not certain about the definition of & apos ; scoreboard & apos ; .
anyone who be English or British or follow cricket know what a scoreboard be .
a scoreboard tell people the score ; it have to be up-to-date and it have to be clear and visible .
I be sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that be so .
at the end of six month I hope that the music be still play and that the European people be still listen .
Mr President , I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry , Mr Costa , and to thank them for the welcome they give my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meeting we enjoy .
Amsterdam and Tampere have give u much work to do together , a the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terrón today show .
I would like to make three brief point .
the first be that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament .
it be barely six month since Amsterdam impose a duty on our two organisation to work together ; we have be size each other up , we have have a few minor spat , but we need to work effectively together .
let u stop the shadow-boxing.Let u drop the elaborate charade and let u respect the duty that the Treaties impose on u and the timescales allow for full democratic debate .
involve u please in your discussion on both policy and process .
let u not pretend that national parliament be able to exercise effective democratic control of government activity in this area .
my second point be that we need a properly resourced Commission .
we have establish a new Directorate-General , yet it have only 70 people all tell .
there be an agreement to double this number , but I understand that , so far , not a single new person have arrive .
we be set the Commission a massive task , not least in the draw up of the scoreboard .
the Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resource that the Commission need .
finally , on the content of the debate , I welcome the fact that the presidency have put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of it agenda .
all good thing come in three , especially in our policy area .
two hundred year ago it be liberty , equality and fraternity , and thing go along very well until the government of the left raise equality above the others .
now it be freedom , security and justice , and I hope that the current government of the left will heed the word of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security , important a it be , above the equally important need of freedom and justice .
although the main achievement in the construction of an area of freedom , security and justice should be mention , we must remember that there be still room for progress .
the role of the Court of Justice be still too limited and communitisation be incomplete .
the unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border control be a clear illustration of this .
the decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights be to be welcome but it be difficult to predict whether it content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic , include all people , whatever their nationality , or exclude some .
the total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political right of all European resident be to be regret .
although action plan establish by the high-level work group aim to limit migratory flow in the future , these plan do nothing to improve human right , civil liberty and the economic situation in the country concern .
we know that readmission clause be include in the cooperation and association agreement .
yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of & apos ; non-refoulement & apos ; & # 91 ; no turn back & # 93 ; .
furthermore , it should be note that these provision be adopt within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consult Parliament .
however , the main concern remain ...
( the President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I would like to join my colleague in welcome the representative of the Council a well a the Commissioner .
I thank them for their statement to the House .
rather than go back over the area that have already be cover I would like to deal with one specific topic : the question of drug and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our society .
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which be do by the Finnish Presidency in bring forward coordinate plan and action between the Member States .
we already have , on the international side , plan in place to combat drug trafficking , money laundering and so on .
Mr President , I would like to use the few second of speaking time to which I be entitle to point out , or remind , the representative of the Commission that , in Belgium , the government be currently pursue a policy under which thousand and possibly ten of thousand of illegal alien be be legalise and be to receive permanent right of residence , right to be reunite with their family , etc .
this be a Belgian government measure which fly in the face of the Schengen Treaty .
I lodge a write complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December .
I would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me , within the foreseeable future , of the step the Commission will take to penalise this violation of the Schengen Treaty by the Belgian State , in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty .
Mr President , esteem gentleman from Portugal , especially the Council representative , you face great expectation on our part .
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectation relatively quickly in at least one small segment .
I refer to Eurodac .
we vote clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument , together with an implementation committee , which would be attach to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be .
we be of the opinion that EURODAC be become a reality .
even in Tampere , we be of the opinion that Eurodac be become a reality .
however , the Council then take another direction at the very next summit in December and take a huge step backwards by decide what we have absolutely reject , i.e . that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation , that the regulatory committee would be attach to the Council and that , where possible , Gibraltar would still be use to exert pressure .
this be a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see .
my urgent request on behalf of the Group be that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac be implement immediately a an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and a an instrument to speed up asylum procedure .
if you tell u today how you wish to proceed , you will be do u a great service .
Mr President , Ministers , Commissioner , the 1999 harvest of decision be indeed rich , so much so that it become difficult to gather , i.e . to put those decision into practice .
I refer in particular to the Council and to the inertia of the Member States in implement the decision they have jointly make .
without wish to ignore the progress which have be make , we , the European Parliament , would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the Council to implement these decision in many area , a well a it lack of common vision and , in particular , the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament .
from what I have say , it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament be not prepared to simply play the role of observer .
neither will it stop raise vital issues.For example , how much progress be you willing to make and what measure , legislative or otherwise , will you be take to combat the scourge of traffic in human being , child pornography on the Internet , drug , and organise crime ?
do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration ?
how do you intend to go about integrate immigrant into the Community , reunite them with their family and recognise their right and duty on an equal footing with those of the citizen of Europe ?
in light of this new international demographic class portray by expert at the UN , be it not about time you abandon your traditional , conservative view on refugee and immigrant ?
I have great expectation for the Portuguese Presidency .
Mr President , I welcome much , indeed most , of what have be say in this debate .
but I want to add a word of caution .
we risk have not too few charter of right in this Community , but too many : national , European Union and European Convention ; not too few tribunal have the final say about our right but possibly too many - there be the Court across the river there , there be the Court in Luxembourg .
there be also court in Karlsruhe , London , Lisbon , Dublin and Edinburgh .
we must make sure that what we do make clear sense .
we must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdiction about right , for that would be the enemy of freedom , justice and security .
we need , in short , to have and to sustain the highest possible common standard and to find way of secure these .
but we must look always to subsidiarity .
like everybody in this House , I want freedom , justice and security.I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation , chaos and confusion .
Madam President , lady and gentleman , I would very quickly like to make one point.Various Members raise question about the Portuguese Presidency .
the President of Parliament have make u aware of the very limited time at our disposal , and my colleague , the Minister for Justice , and I therefore propose to reply objectively to all the question put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attend next week .
( sustain applause )
thank you , Minister .
the debate be close .
Mr President , I be grateful for the Council & apos ; s oral , and also write , reply .
their efficiency have be truly remarkable .
I will save a few second because I want to propose to the Council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens & apos ; Rights and Freedoms , Justice and Home Affairs .
then we will have the opportunity to comment on these reply and to express our concern to the Commission a well .
personally , I be pleased with some of the reply , for example , in relation to issue a sensitive a Schengen and the Europol Convention , which we hope will be review , and I be pleased with the word of the Minister for Justice with regard to try to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authority .
I also hope that the same be do in relation to parliamentary control .
representative of the Council , within the next month we be go to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament .
I be sure that , with the willingness that you have show today , the first thing you will do , in this new climate of understand between u , will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you .
question Time ( Council )
the next item be Question Time ( B5-0003 / 2000 ) .We will examine question to the Council .
question No 1 by ( H-0780 / 99 ) :
what step will the Council take to prevent nuclear accident and the proliferation of nuclear weapon in a country that wish to join the EU but spend enormous amount on nuclear programme while receive financial aid from the EU budget ?
Mr President , the Council wish to point out that Turkey be a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety , the objective of which should allay the fear express by Mr Souladakis .
the aim of this convention , which come into force on 24 October 1996 , be precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by mean of national measure and through international cooperation .
it further aim to ensure that nuclear installation be equip with continue protection against potential radiological risk , so a to protect individual , society at large and the environment against the harmful effect of the ionising radiation that can be emit by such installation .
the convention , a you will be aware , also cover the prevention of accident which have radiological effect and the limitation of such effect when incident of this kind occur .
thank you for your answer .
however , I would just like to add the following .
Turkey be only look to increase it energy potential by 2 % with this unit .
nevertheless , rumour have it that it plan to buy Candu reactor of the type acquire by Pakistan and India which be use for nuclear weapon .
in this respect , the issue require closer examination , because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people & apos ; s suspicion .
my second point concern the safety of these plant .
in area of high seismic risk , it be not enough just to have secure , earthquake-proof buildings.Speaking a an engineer , I can tell you that we carry out test to investigate the effect of certain risk factor in extreme circumstance .
however , we can not carry out test on nuclear plant which be in operation ; it be just not possible .
with this in mind , it go without say that nuclear plant a priori should not be build in area prone to earthquake .
in this respect , and because Turkey be situate on the periphery of the European Union , we should be help it to become a more secure , peaceful and cooperative country .
that be our role and this be the point of my question .
I recognise the relevance of the argument that Mr Souladakis have put forward .
this be , of course , a highly sensitive issue .
furthermore , it will be evident that this be a matter that do not only affect Turkey , in view of that country & apos ; s proximity to the exist territory of the European Union.It also affect other state neighbour the EU with which we maintain relation .
we understand your concern and will certainly take account of them , particularly during the discussion that we will be have with Turkey to define that country & apos ; s own pre-accession strategy agenda .
this question will naturally be one of our key concern , and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account .
thank you , Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council .
I be sure the President-in-Office of the Council be a very nice man and be very kind to his wife and his child and his dog .
however , forgive me if I be a little sceptical of the reply you have just give me .
I do not believe that the statement make within the Council and the vote be available to the public immediately .
will you please therefore undertake , before the next plenary in February , to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public , immediately the Council have pass legislation , rather than wait for it to come out week later on a press release list .
will you write to me before the next plenary with that information ?
Mr Newton Dunn , I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comment with which you start your second question , and I would be grateful if you could refrain from make such comment in future .
with regard to what you be say , it make me think that the criticism level at the Council , apart from be formulate in a very specific way of which we also take note , do not actually refer to the opacity , shall we say , of the legislative process , but rather almost to an excess of transparency .
however , I would like to say , Mr Newton Dunn , that the result of this kind of process for transparency be quite obvious to u and we consider them to be unquestionable .
we have no problem , Mr Newton Dunn , in repeat this information to you in write , but we will not be able to go any further than what have be say here , because that meet the requirement of the Treaty exactly .
we therefore consider that the General Secretariat of the Council be at present make available to the public all essential information regard the Council & apos ; s function a a legislative body .
I do not consider that the Council try to answer my question .
I do not ask what the Council thought of the proposal which the Commission have still not table .
instead , my question concern the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
do this permit legislation also to be pass concern national law on transparency and not only in connection with the three institution of the European Union refer to there ?
I should like to have an answer to that question .
do the Council consider that , on the basis of Article 255 of the Treaty , national legislation on transparency can be regulate , that be to say legislation not relate to the EU & apos ; s institution ?
Mr Sjöstedt , the answer that I give be the only answer possible .
nevertheless , I would like to say that any interpretation of Article 255 of the Treaty must also be link to the principle of subsidiarity .
at the moment , there be no concrete proposal which would allow u to make adjustment under this Article , and unless there be such a proposal , we can not move forward on this matter .
in any event , Article 255 do not , at first sight , allow work to be do on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity .
I be , up to a point , concern about how the Council will fight for the principle contain in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose be to ensure that citizen have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process .
how be this to be do when , at the same time , the Commission & apos ; s proposal - which have be leak , so the general public be aware of it - say that employee & apos ; freedom of thought come before transparency and that it be not possible to have access to work document , report , draft etc ?
do not the Council & apos ; s representative think that this make it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process ?
Mrs Frahm , the question that you raise be extremely important and we discuss it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference .
I would like to say that transparency do not only apply from the Community institution & quot ; outwards & quot ; , it also apply between the institution .
by this I mean that there be aspect of the form and procedure of the Community institution & apos ; working which be not accessible to the other institution , and not only a regard the Commission & apos ; s relationship with Parliament , but also a regard the Commission & apos ; s relationship with the Council .
a a matter of fact , at the last conference , this issue be raise and discuss on several occasion .
the European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference .
the matter be still open .
genuine transparency of the institution & apos ; working and the way they be present throughout Europe be an extremely important issue and one which , in my opinion , need to be study again , particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference .
we have no doubt about this and we think that the Members take part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again .
I believe that the Commission & apos ; s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in term of the way the various institution function , but I think that there be always room for improvement in this matter .
for our part , we be prepared to study any proposal make in this area .
it be a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and others have ask .
we have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthen democracy and ensure that there be a worthwhile dialogue between citizen , decision maker and authority .
we be very anxious indeed that the EU , too , should move in this direction , and this be also state in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
one or two year ago , Parliament adopt a report by Mrs Lööw which be extremely important in this context .
the report warn that the forthcoming process would lead to restriction upon the transparency of the Member States .
we can now see that there be perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament .
I want to ask the Council if it understand this warning , in view of what we have now see in the working document from the Commission .
I listen very carefully to what Mr Seixas da Costa have to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference .
my concern be , if I have understood Mr Seixas da Costa correctly on the interesting point he make a regard transparency and the IGC , whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference .
after all , examine the issue of transparency in the way the institution operate should never be hide away under any old heading or confine to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobby .
it should have it own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference , which would mean widen the agenda .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos , transparency be naturally an issue of concern to the institution .
this Intergovernmental Conference will , at the outset , concentrate on improve the way the institution operate , particularly take account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic , more transparent and more efficient .
all of this must nevertheless be do whilst respect a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solution we may devise to achieve these three aim .
it be obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will , of course , feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference .
I can assure you that this be an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representative of the preparatory group for the conference .
it must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament , who will surely rally behind this proposal .
we will then see , at ministerial level , how we can follow this up .
it should nevertheless be note that we have just conclude the Treaty of Amsterdam , which be approve last May , and that there be a raft of implement measure on transparency which be still in progress .
the question be whether it be premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency .
my feeling be that , in spite of everything , this issue will always have to be on the agenda , because the public be clearly concern about it , and because it be link with the need to make the European institution accountable to the public .
a far a we be concern , they will be .
we shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter .
question No 5 by ( H-0785 / 99 ) :
subject : proposal for a regulation lay down the total admissible catch for specific fish population for the year 2000 , and the case of anchovy in particular The latest report from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stock in ICES zone VIII be critical .
do the Council believe that it be permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violate the originally establish TAC of 33 000 metric tonne per year , give the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stock ?
what measure do the Council intend to adopt , and when , with a view to take proper account of the critical state of anchovy stock , the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability ?
Mr President , the Portuguese Presidency be extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question , particularly because it broach an issue which concern Portugal in a positive way , and I shall explain how .
the Council be aware of the critical level of anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers .
nevertheless , at the last Fisheries Council of 1999 , hold on 16 and 17 December , the Member States involve in this area of fishing , namely France , Spain and Portugal , consider that apply the precautionary principle which set a TAC reduce from 5 000 tonne to 2 000 tonne , a the Commission propose , be excessively cautious .
a compromise solution be therefore reach in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risk , that be the specie of fish be affect , and the socio-economic problem cause by fish limits.This be achieve by fix the TAC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonne instead of the 33 000 set in 1999 .
it be also stipulate that this would be revise in the light of new scientific information on preserve specie , of which we hope to see example in the first six month of this year .
a for the Southern stock of anchovy in ICES zone IX , the TAC be fix at 10 000 tonne for the whole of 2000 a oppose to 13 000 tonne in 1999 .
fish quota transfer between Portugal and France be reduce proportionally from 5 008 tonne in 1999 to 3 000 tonne in 2000 , for fishing in French water .
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fish on anchovy stock overall , over the whole Community fishing area .
in accordance with the principle of relative stability , 90 % of stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay be allocate to Spain and only 10 % to France .
without this transfer from Portuguese water , the level of the Bay of Biscay TAC would have to be multiply by ten in order to grant adequate catch to France .
that be why I think that this be quite positive from Portugal & apos ; s point of view .
this situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stock than the risk refer to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea , which we also understand .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I must say that your comment have not satisfy me at all .
I understand that Portugal be affect by this .
it have be show , a we have be claim since 1995 , that this move be appal , and , if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement , that be fine by u , but these anchovy should be fish in Portuguese fishing ground and not in the Bay of Biscay .
today , scientific study show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay be in danger of extinction , and now there will be measure to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fish in that Bay .
I do not know if you be aware , representative of the Council of Ministers , of your responsibility over these last few year , and in 2000 a well , for the plight of the family who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular .
the Court also state that the principle of relative stability have not be violate since the anchovy quota allocate to Spain in zone VIII have be maintain at 90 % and France & apos ; s at 10 % .
apart from this , Mr Ortuondo Larrea , the Court be of the opinion that the transfer effect between Portugal and France do not violate the principle of exploit live sea and freshwater resource in a rational and responsible way , on the ground that the fishing pressure in zone VIII and IX neither increase nor adversely affect the overall quota of these resource allocate to Spain .
accordingly , Mr Ortuondo Larrea , the Council reiterate it opinion that without this transfer , greater account would be take of France & apos ; s possibility for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay .
the Council therefore reiterate it opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population number than the solution which be eventually choose .
in concrete term , 3 000 tonne represent 57.5 % of Portugal & apos ; s fishing opportunity in 2000 against 5 008 tonne or 73.9 % in 1999 .
these number represent , in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council , a real improvement in term of conservation in comparison with the level of 80 % lay down in Council Regulation 685 / 95 .
question No 6 by ( H-0788 / 99 ) :
subject : measure to combat the continue ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999 , NATO & apos ; s Defence Ministers make a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo & apos ; s minority community .
in it resolution refer to specific atrocity commit against Serbs and Romanies , Parliament also vigorously condemn the continue violence against the Serb population and call on the leader of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244 .
the resolution also stress that previous persecution of the Albanians can not constitute a pretext for killing , abduction , detention , intimidation , arson , looting , destruction of property and the taking-over of house etc .
in the light of the above , will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo , a request by Parliament ?
what other practical measure will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing ?
Mr Alavanos , I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlie the issue you have raise .
we genuinely share your concern about the threatening situation which exist in Kosovo for ethnic minority , for both the Serb and Romany population , and the incident of discrimination , harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region .
the Council have always stress the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrate such act and of those who continue to perpetrate such act .
the Council once again reiterate the need , in it December conclusion , to fully implement Security Council resolution 12 / 99 and have consistently support Bernard Kouchner & apos ; s effort to implement measure to guarantee effective protection of minority in the region and , in particular , to guarantee that measure facilitate the preservation of the region & apos ; s multi-ethnic make-up be effectively implement .
in our contact with senior political figure amongst the Kosovo Albanians , we have stress - and the Portuguese Prime Minister do this very recently - that persecution of the Serb population , the Romany population and other ethnic group be totally unacceptable .
it will not be tolerate , and must stop immediately .
it have be communicate explicitly and repeatedly to Kosovar leader that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-Albanian minority be treat .
I think that this be an extremely important point : this sense of conditionality , which underlie the European Union & apos ; s position , be be maintain by the Council and will continue to be maintain .
we have fully support the effort of the United Nations mission and the international security force in Kosovo to prevent further outbreak of violence against minority and to protect the population under threat .
KFOR and the UNMIC police consider one of their two main task to be prevent any form of maltreatment on the ground of a person & apos ; s ethnic origin .
the Council therefore express it satisfaction , in it December conclusion , at the substantial contribution announce by the European Commission , which will indirectly assist in return the situation to normal , together with similar contribution make by Member States .
nevertheless , Mr Alavanos , the Council be also aware that the total amount of resource make available to the appropriate international organisation in Kosovo do not match the desired amount , in term of what the various Member States have be able to raise , and this have limit the real ability of these organisation to act on the ground .
we shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authority and of the organisation represent Albanians in the region also depend on the ability of these organisation to prove themselves capable of implement measure which will guarantee the region & apos ; s multi-ethnic nature .
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council .
I believe - a I think we all do - that Portugal , it former president , Mr Soares , and it government , maintain a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombing in the Balkans .
today & apos ; s political statement on this issue be very positive indeed , and one which I welcome .
however , there be some concern over the lack of progress make despite the good and honest intention express by the European Union .
unfortunately , we have recently witness the eradication of Serb , Romany , Turkish , and Croatian minority in Kosovo and we be now wonder what will happen next .
the United Nation & apos ; s , and Mr Kouchner & apos ; s , mission in Kosovo end in failure .
this failure be illustrate by the fact that after an entire war that be wag to put an end to ethnic cleansing , we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side .
and so I would like to repeat my question a to whether the Council intend to take more specific action to debate these issue with Mr Kouchner , who have a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today .
Mr Alavanos , I can not agree with what you just say in your last sentence on Mr Kouchner & apos ; s responsibility , and I would like to make two very important point here.The structure be implement in Kosovo be under the auspex of the United Nations .
it be a structure to which the European Union have give a much support a it can and to which the country of the European Union have contribute in various way .
there be one thing , however , that we can not deny , and that be that Mr Kouchner & apos ; s effort to return Kosovo & apos ; s internal situation to normal have be extremely positive .
this be undeniable , even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the result of these effort , for reason beyond Mr Kouchner & apos ; s control , have not be a effective a we would all have like them to be .
I have one last point to make , which be about the European Union & apos ; s responsibility and , specifically , in this case , about possible action by the Council in this matter , and the responsibility of the international community , which have overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo .
therefore , the responsibility of the European Union have to be see in a certain context .
it be the international community , and specifically the United Nations , which should be hold responsible for implement Resolution 12 / 99 and , in particular , for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality .
these be question which we should all be ask , but the forum for put these question be the United Nations .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I heartily welcome the fact that you have say that you wish to improve structure , in the aim of improve the credibility of the authority .
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public .
the question which I therefore ask myself be this : have in fact a start be make on how we can promote the medium in this area , how we can train journalist and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence ?
we have endeavour to provide material help .
we have try to defend peace by take military action .
what be the situation now a regard effort to include psychological criterion in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here ?
Mr Rübig , a I say , I understand your concern very well .
I think that , at the moment , particularly in the last few month , there have be some positive development in term of the resource that will be available to Mr Kouchner , in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently .
I hear Mr Kouchner speak at the Council of Europe ministerial meeting on this issue , and I think that many of the concern he express then about the lack of resource need to overcome some of the problem have now be addressed.In other word , he have be give these resource .
there be two fundamental question in particular .
firstly , an increase in police number would be an important factor in guarantee the safety of the civilian population and , in particular , in protect certain section of the civilian population.Secondly , an increase in appropriation would allow some official who have important role in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be keep on .
the issue which we should all raise , and I do so myself , in a diplomatic way , a while ago , concern the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12 / 99 .
I know that this be an extremely delicate issue , but we should all be question the logic behind this resolution and it chance of be implement .
we advocate that it should be implement in it entirety .
what we have to do , and we in the European Union be already do it , be to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resource , and you be right , Mr Rübig , we have a duty to our citizen to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resource be be properly use .
we in the Council will be try to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency .
Mr Seixas da Costa , I totally agree with you .
the problem be not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he be work , namely Resolution 1244 .
have say this , the EU & apos ; s responsibility , which be both yours and ours , be to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region .
it be the failure to define this scenario which be cause or encourage the excess , accident and assassination mention by Mr Alavanos .
do the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo ?
if so , do it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region , avoid a far a possible the multiplication of micro-States , a have tend to happen elsewhere , and reunite the party , in this case Kosovo and Albania ?
question No 8 by ( H-0796 / 99 ) :
subject : new INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to it draft Communication on INTERREG entitle : promotion of urban , rural and coastal development , the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centre use a joint cross-border strategy .
however , housing be specifically exclude .
give the fact that there be many house in rural area which be of historic interest , include small cottage , and , give the need , for a variety of reason , to maintain rural population and to attract people to rural area , do not the Council agree that these objective could be assist if housing project be fund in the area cover by INTERREG ?
Mr President , the Council and , I think , the Portuguese Presidency in particular , be extremely aware of the importance of the problem Mr Gallagher & apos ; s question raise and I would like to say that we have always pay the utmost attention to Community policy for the development of rural area .
I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopt a new system for support rural development which be the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development .
this be , a you know , one of the change make during the Agenda 2000 negotiation and it change the way in which agricultural issue be dealt with at Community level .
through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund , the EAGGF , this Community support framework be design to help reverse the trend of abandon rural area , an issue you be quite right to raise .
on the other hand , the European Regional Development Fund , the ERDF , also contribute a part of it role to promote social and economic cohesion , by redress the main regional imbalance and encourage rural area to take part in development and conversion .
in this regard , we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contribute to promote sustainable rural development and to create sustainable employment in rural area .
this combination of instrument enables u to implement a policy of rural development which today , furthermore , be one of the way in which the common agricultural policy - in one of it dimension - and regional policy also , have develop and change .
we think that this be one of the most fundamental issue within the concept of multifunctionality which be now associate with change in the common agricultural policy , and the EAGGF , of course , have a crucial role to play in this .
question No 9 by ( H-0798 / 99 ) :
subject : farming and the Portuguese Presidency Will the Council outline the priority of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six month a regard the common agricultural policy and indicate the step it feel be necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sector and product adversely affect by recent health scare ?
your question on the common agricultural policy be one which we take very seriously and which should always be consider in this House & apos ; s discussion , because in the future we be likely to discuss this issue at great length .
during the Portuguese Presidency , we will be continue discussion on the CAP , by adapt some of the common market organisation with a view to develop the Union & apos ; s rural area in an appropriate way and guarantee an improvement in farmer & apos ; income , pay particular attention to measure which could have an impact on small family-run farm .
on the other hand , the Portuguese Presidency will continue , if and when the new WTO round begin within it term of office , which be by no mean guarantee , to ensure that the presence of Community production on international market be strengthened.It will also continue to ensure a greater balance between export Community farm product and preserve the multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just refer .
the Portuguese Presidency also attach importance to reinforce food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already refer to this aspect this morning .
we think that the role of food safety , specifically in term of everything link to public health , be one of our presidency & apos ; s essential tasks.It be therefore one of the priority of our programme .
we shall be develop it in four parallel scheme , in the Agriculture Council , the Health Council , the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council .
at the Santa Maria da Feira European Council meeting in June , the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission present in it White Paper a few day ago .
this be what we shall be try to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope , at the end of it , to be able to present the result of our effort to this House .
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply .
I be sure that he be aware of the very serious threat to the European model which be base on family farming , mainly those farmer involve in beef and sheepmeat production who be now expect to sell their produce at or below production cost .
I completely understand your concern , and I feel that there be a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue .
we also have to think of the consequence , especially in term of financing and compensate farmer .
nevertheless , a you know , this issue be now in the hand of the European Commission and it will have to take this further .
the Council & apos ; s ability to intervene in this matter be strictly limit .
Mr President , I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber .
but I do not think he answer my question with regard specifically to tackle homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisation actively involve in this field .
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policy and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying cause of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency .
my specific question concern the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulty the President-in-Office allude to with regard to support at intergovernmental level .
I feel this be one area where Europe can play a very active role , even if only in provide the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States .
Mr Crowley , with regard to the presidency & apos ; s scope for support action by non-governmental organisation , particularly those which attempt to resolve the problem face by the homeless , I would like to say that such initiative be welcome , and we be very much open to the possibility of support them .
we have work closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiative they have propose within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency , which we be combine with the wide range of concern underpin our whole programme .
we have no specific , concrete initiative in this area but that do not mean that we be close to the idea that an initiative propose to u by NGOs in this area might be consider during our presidency .
it should be point out that this can only be do within the Council & apos ; s scope for action .
any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission & apos ; s right of initiative will obviously have to be do through the Commission itself .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you have talk a lot about the future , about what the Commission will do , and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon , etc.However , you also say something which I find particularly frightening .
you say that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development .
I be begin to feel a little worried because this may lead , partially at least , to exclusion .
I do not see how you could , with the view that you hold , provide any answer .
what I ask and what I be once again ask be the following : what be the view of the Portuguese Presidency on , for example , the appeal make by the network to combat poverty and exclusion , the division of work and social security , the implementation of tax policy , particularly for speculative capital , and the policy of redistribute wealth ?
I would like an answer a to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intend to do something about these matter .
you must understand that a presidency & apos ; s ability to reverse global social or economic trend during it six month in office be actually quite limited .
I think that it be also obvious that our ability to act be link to the Commission & apos ; s own scope for intervening , through it right of initiative .
I have speak about the Special European Council and about Portugal & apos ; s initiative in convene it , and I have speak about the future , because there be two complementary way of see the issue of social exclusion .
the Portuguese Presidency do not have a magic wand with which it can , in six month , resolve problem that have always exist .
it be prepare to act on proposal by the Commission in any area for which there be Community competence .
it also have the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measure which may be present , specifically by non-governmental organisation , but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which be traditional in these matter .
we should , however , also bear in mind , Mr Papayannakis , that we can not act in an area which will have such a big financial impact , arm only with the measure a presidency can propose in the space of six month .
we therefore think that all the measure we have highlight in term of long-term strategy , regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term , some of the homeless may be dead , will help u to guarantee sustainable policy in the European Union .
we will try to move these strategy forward a much a possible during our presidency .
question No 12 by ( H-0801 / 99 ) :
subject : Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priority of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy , the Convention of Lomé and tackle famine situation ?
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question , and indeed the Minister who speak to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outline the position .
but there be some question still outstanding .
there do not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme .
the situation of AIDS in Africa now be so serious that more people be die of AIDS than be die in conflict .
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue .
Medicines be available in the United States but the United States be not make them cheap enough for the people in Africa .
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he be do about the situation that be develop in Ethiopia where there be drought , where the crop have fail , and where , in six month & apos ; time , we will inevitably be back to the situation a it be some year ago in Ethiopia with famine and people die in their thousand .
at the same time , there be a war go on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armament industry in Europe be not short in send gun , after which we will send the bread .
first of all , Mr Andrews , you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague & apos ; s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development.There be no contradiction between our two position , quite the opposite .
unless we wish to act like megalomaniac , we can not in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situation relate to all the enormous issue we face , particularly in the area of external relation .
a you can understand , it would be easy to do so .
all we would have to do be get a directory of development and put all the item in our programme , one after the other .
we be sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within government & apos ; ability to act and within the scope of the Council .
we must understand that there be limitation on what we can achieve , particularly in term of manage national indicative programme .
you have mention Ethiopia , which fall within the scope of national indicative programme , but there be , a you know , several Community action to combat AIDS , and in this respect , you be right , and the United States will probably not do any better .
indeed , in term of development aid policy , I think that Europe have absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compare very favourably with that of the United States .
your question switch to the subject of arm , a broader policy issue which I do not think fall within the scope of this question but which the Council will , of course , address in the future , if it see fit and if it decide to put it in a specific context .
be the Council aware of the social problem cause by the export of food by the EU to develop country at price below the cost of production ?
do the presidency intend to do anything about this ?
since the author be not present , Question No 13 lapse .
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council , and I would personally like to welcome him and the Portuguese Presidency .
please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he be on European affair .
unfortunately , in my case , he do not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer .
since the Council recognise the fact that culture be a major economic asset , it should , in my view , demonstrate this in practice .
say that the cultural dimension be govern by the principle of subsidiarity and that it be therefore national government who be responsible be , I be afraid , just an excuse .
my question , which have not be answer , be why , when the European Parliament be look to increase appropriation to fund cultural programme within the European Union , the Council and the Commission be cut back on appropriation and at time cut them out altogether .
this be a true example of the Council & apos ; s indifference towards culture , despite it assurance to the contrary that it be a matter to which it attach great importance .
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it be prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness a it support banana , hop , cow and Indian hemp .
Mr Marinos , we be not adopt a purely economic approach to manage the Portuguese Presidency , and therefore , the cultural dimension be , I be sure you will appreciate , one of our main concern .
these cultural dimension , however , almost always have their own economic dimension in turn , that be the level of resource which can be call on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiative .
this be a dimension which it be difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union , and especially within the framework of the Council .
for our part , we shall be attempt to strengthen and consolidate the European position on cultural good and service and on activity in this sphere , because we believe that this be an identifying feature which be crucial to the Union & apos ; s image and to the Union & apos ; s own particular identity .
this be , and will continue to be , connect with development within the World Trade Organisation .
a you know , both we and the Council have address this issue appropriately .
in specific term , we have be able to find a common language in term of the mandate give to the Commission for the next round of WTO negotiation , at which this will be a central issue .
nevertheless , I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy , and in particular the audiovisual dimension , the Portuguese Presidency will be pay very close attention to extend and enrich European audiovisual policy by adopt a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allay Europe & apos ; s main fear .
we also intend to initiate a new debate , a more innovative one , on the issue of Europe & apos ; s film heritage , give that this must be one of the most important factor in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy .
the Presidency will also concentrate on discussion about create a digital television system in Europe , which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organise during the Portuguese Presidency , in conjunction with the Commission , in February 2000 .
but , Mr Marinos , in the EU context , culture be an issue which be repeatedly raise in connection with IGC agenda .
if , by chance , it be possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what have be call the fifth negotiate box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , then this could be suggest , both by Member States , and by the Members of the European Parliament take part in the preparatory group .
of course , if consensus could be reach on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference , there might eventually be progress .
it remain to be see whether or not there be a consensus on this .
we will soon see , and for our part , we will bear in mind any suggestion on this issue .
Mr President , I join others in wish Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency .
I notice that you say this particular issue be not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wish it , you would consider it .
well , I , and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it .
I appreciate that it be a provocative question .
it be mean to provoke because there be a very serious issue here that some country do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserve .
we have to find some way of put pressure on such country to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizen .
I can not think of a better way to do it .
can you ?
the issue be whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker a a result of be specifically integrate into the Treaties .
this be an issue which , a you will understand , will have to be address at IGC level and be an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue , because this kind of issue fall outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place .
Intergovernmental Conferences be a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree .
it be therefore not out of the question that these issue , which crop up again and again , and which be pass from one conference to another , may be address .
the problem face u at the moment be whether there be currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue be include , particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue be include , other issue of a similar nature will probably be add to the conference & apos ; s agenda .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos have the floor for a procedural motion .
I would ask him to be brief .
Mr President , I understand that I have to do this very quickly .
I like what Mr Seixas da Costa say about Father Christmas .
in Spain they say a letter to the three king .
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament have already send a letter to the three king through it report .
now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the present which we have ask them for in our letter to the three king .
a I suspect , it be not exactly a procedural motion , but more a closing of the debate .
we thank Mr Seixas da Costa , but he can also write his letter to the three king .
I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos have raise be an extremely important one .
the problem be that in this case Father Christmas have to follow order and therefore he can only give present when he be authorise by others to do so .
it be not the Portuguese Presidency & apos ; s job to hand out the present that everyone want , especially those that the European Parliament be ask for .
after this interesting exchange of opinion , and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , I would like to tell you that Questions Nos 17 to 27 will be reply to in writing .
that conclude question to the Council .
capital tax
the next item be the joint debate on :
the oral question ( B5-0004 / 2000 ) by Mr Désir and others , to the Council , on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax
the oral question ( B5-0005 / 2000 ) by Mr Désir and others , to the Commission , on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , during the Asian crisis in 1997 , a with those which hit Mexico in 1995 or the EMS in 1993 , everyone could see the damage cause to the economy of entire country by financial speculation , particularly currency speculation .
between EUR 1 500 and 2 000 billion be trade every day on the financial markets.In three or four day , this can equal the total figure of annual global production , or global GDP , of approximately EUR 6 000 billion .
the bulk of these financial transaction be purely speculative and do not involve any trade in good or investment .
yet the erratic movement of these massive sum of capital can , in a few hour , cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country , plunge it whole population into recession .
note that this propose tax , which seem to be produce strong emotion in some people , would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation.Yet it would represent the recapture of the area seize from democracy by the financial sphere .
one reason for the acceptance of this proposal , and of the campaign by NGOs such a ATTAC , SOLIDAR or others which have popularise this proposal , be that it would release resource which could be allocate to development programme in the poorest country , in area such a education or health .
it could act a a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there be both increase wealth and increase poverty .
many personality and institution have come out in favour of this tax such a the Brazilian President , Fernando Cardoso , the Finnish Government , the Canadian Parliament last March and also Lionel Jospin in 1995 .
this question have be debate in several national parliament of the EU .
the common response have be that this tax could not be apply solely at national level and that the right platform for tackle this be the European Union.This be the reason for the oral question to the Council and Commission which we have table with 37 other Members .
this motion ask the Commission to present a report to Parliament within six month on the feasibility of this tax.It also ask for an examination of the pressure and financial sanction which could be apply against country which encourage tax evasion or which maintain tax haven .
one of the most common objection be that such a tax would be too complex , but this could be say of any tax.If this argument have be accept in the past , then no tax would ever have be create .
the motion also ask that a position document , draw up by the Commission and Council , should be submit before the next annual meeting of the IMF .
the European Union must take the initiative and must also , a demand in the motion , propose this initiative to the G7 because it be primarily a political question .
if the Union take the initiative , this will have a ratchet effect because this debate be occur all over the world , include in the USA and Japan.A desire be be express everywhere with increase force that the world should not be rule by trader but by the people , their parliament , their government and their democratic institution .
Europe must play a role in this new international regulation and I be extremely happy that today , with this debate and this motion , this question be now on the agenda of European construction .
Madam President , I do not have a great deal to add on this subject .
the Council have not yet discuss the possibility of introduce a tax on movement of capital a Professor Tobin suggest .
this be a creative initiative , which we know have be welcome by different industry across the world and by various side in European politics , but the Commission have not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue .
a it fall to the Commission to propose any such initiative , the Council have not yet be able to adopt a position on this issue .
Madam President , the revenue basis of the Tobin tax be say to be make up of very short-term exchange transaction .
such transaction , accord to the argument , bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables.This have also just be underline by Mr Désir .
therefore , accord to proponent , such a Mr Désir , an internationally applied Tobin tax would , in principle , reduce speculative transaction and , hence , the volatility of exchange rate , which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity .
take into account the considerable volume of short-term financial stream , even a low nominal Tobin tax would yield respectable sum of tax revenue .
in reality , the motive underlie the increase interest in the Tobin tax and other source of international finance in the mid-nineties be non-economic .
indeed , it be fuel by the potential of this tax to generate income for international , public programme at a time when demand for such fund be rise quickly and funding be increasingly harder to come by .
the Commission recently observe renew interest in a global tax , such a the Tobin tax , a a mean of achieve socially responsible globalisation , so to speak .
Mr Désir too have mention this grow interest on all side .
but if the Tobin tax be to be apply unilaterally in order to prevent attack on a specific currency , then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market .
put more strongly , in the long term it be possible that for large number of fund , the Tobin tax will be evade by shift foreign exchange rate transaction to off-shore tax haven .
in that case , the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity .
so the Tobin tax can only be effective if there be a sufficient number of industrialised country which be prepare to participate .
finally , even if the Tobin tax be design to curb speculation with currency , there be still the risk that even non-speculative stream would be affect , and that be not the intention .
for the reason set out above , I can not see a good reason for introduce a European Tobin tax .
at any rate , the Commission be against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the European Union .
in more direct term , to the extent that this measure could be deem an indirect restriction on capital stream , this would contravene the Treaty of Rome .
the correct speculative approach , it seem to me , be to remove the real cause which lead to financial chaos , rather than attempt to suppress it symptom by introduce obstacle to the operation of the market .
Madam President , Commissioner , I should like once again to say a few word on the modus operandi and the ideological tactic behind this oral question .
also because I know how many social democrat in this House share our criticism , and not just the economic and financial policy expert .
we know what the problem be : instability on the market a the result of speculation .
but the people ask the question need to know that not every instance of instability , a the Commissioner have just so impressively tell u , be the result of speculation .
the Tobin tax would not have be able to prevent the crisis in the EEA in 1992 and 1993 or the crisis in the south-east Asian currency in 1997 .
the initiator of this question do not propose a solution ; instead they be call for a new burden , they be call for more bureaucracy , for a measure which run counter to the market mechanism and they be take up plenary & apos ; s time with an intergroup opinion which exclude the competent parliamentary committee , contrary to several resolution by Parliament .
in my view , and I say this quite clearly , the question be ideologically motivate rather than solution-focused .
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reason .
why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable ?
first , and the Commissioner have also confirm this , because it place a heavy burden on the capital market .
even a small tax would have serious repercussion on the capital market , because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investment considerably .
in addition , this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial market and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital , which be one of the central tenet of the internal market .
secondly , speculative capital be extremely difficult to identify .
thirdly , unless they be introduce in all country at the same time , tax measure be easy to circumvent because there be otherwise too many loophole .
fourthly , technically speak , this measure be highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control .
the measure which we should be take be part of the resolution before u here today .
we need stronger banking supervision .
we need to clarify the liability for transaction .
we need a framework of regulation at international level .
we need to examine national law in order to check that they comply with the rule of the Basle committee and how the dissemination of these rule can be step up .
I have a serious problem with one of the central point of this resolution which we can not accept a it stand .
I refer to point 9 .
have listen to the Commissioner just now , we know that the Commission & apos ; s knowledge of the fact will result in a & apos ; no & apos ; to the Tobin tax .
if the knowledge of the fact and this debate and the argument be a we say , and I think that they be right , then to take up another six month of the Commission & apos ; s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital market would be irresponsible .
the capital market do not want uncertainty from u , they want clarity ; which be why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote .
Madam President , the debate on a tax on short-term financial action be not a new one .
we have be discuss the Tobin tax proposal for twenty year and yet the question be still topical because we need really concrete and honest answer base on careful study .
we need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transaction really be .
this question have now enter a different dimension , a dimension in which USD 1 500 billion roam the world twenty-four hour a day look for attractive investment , no more than 3 % of which have anything to do with the real economy .
we be concern about stability on the financial market , not for the sake of the financial market , but because this have to do with own growth , our own investment and our own job in the European Union .
we must ask what instrument we can use in order to create the order here which have be miss in the past .
we have do everything to help liberalise financial transaction , but so far we have have no work set of rule , a we have learn from the bitter lesson of the repercussion of the Asian and Latin American crisis .
it be therefore high time that we think both about supervisory regulation and about transparency on the financial market and their information .
it be important that we know who the actor be and what their credit rating be .
we must also ask if there be not a need for fiscal justice .
at a time when the tax burden on the work factor be increase throughout Europe and internationally , we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that include the question of how to tax short-term financial transaction .
I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusion from the Commission , so that we a the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieve real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in make the economy and the financial market more stable and secure .
this be the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedure of report from committee and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal .
I will have to repeat these argument , modestly , in this intervention , because the same issue have arise once again .
we do not agree with this type of tax because it application , in the event that it could happen , would not achieve the aim which Mr Tobin present at the time and which the Left in this House wish to revive .
firstly , there be no evidence that the tax on international capital movement could reduce the danger of volatility and instability in the international market .
on the contrary , since it be certain that not all country would accept it , we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility , instability , insecurity , opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial service operate on an international level .
furthermore , the idea of obtain resource to apply them to the more economically needy country present such complexity , when we consider their application in practice , that it appear simply impossible .
this be a false debate whose aim be purely political , and have no basis or technical viability .
furthermore - since we be in this European Parliament - if we have still not manage the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measure propose by the Commission within the European Union , how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level ?
I suppose that the first thing they say will be , & apos ; let u see whether you be capable of reach a fiscal agreement within the Union & apos ; .
however , the Liberal Group have not want to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and , therefore , we have accept a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carry out on the possibility and suitability of impose this tax on certain area of international capital movement .
I be sure that this study - if carry out objectively , with knowledge of the financial market and their mechanism on an international level - will show that it be neither suitable nor possible , not only in term of it application , but also a a mean of achieve the propose objective .
in itself , globalisation be positive .
the economy have never grow so much nor favour so many country on a global level .
this be due to progressive open up and greater freedom in the international trade in good and service and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital .
any analysis of economic development in recent year , if objective , will show , through the figure , that they have no political colour or orientation .
a I have say , we be not oppose to such a study .
we will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study , but we simply insist that , a this motion for a resolution point out , it be by mean of liberalisation and open up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress , both on the level of state and on a general level .
Madam President , Commissioner , the problem do not lie in the ideology of the debate but in it political nature .
a Mrs Randzio-Plath say , we must remember that the reason why certain Members want to revive this question be because of the recent international financial crisis and their economic , social and environmental consequence which have be felt by all in some country .
the main objective of this debate be to look at the instrument available to the international community for stabilise the international financial and monetary system .
in this respect , Mr Bolkestein , the motion for a resolution can not be separate from the issue of the Tobin tax .
if you look carefully , this propose tax on capital be just one of several instrument aim at force international investor to behave responsibly on the financial market .
secondly , the motion do not say that we want a solely European initiative .
this be why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund so that the European Union , in other word the Commission and also the Council , can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation .
there should be no confusion in this debate.As environmentalist , we do not want an excuse for a motion .
although a study produce by the Commission would doubtless be interesting , we do not need another to add to those already available .
a for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty , very short-term capital movement be specifically intend to play on uncertainty and to bet on change between currency or various short-term financial asset .
this argument be therefore not relevant .
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone have their argument .
however , I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion , but also paragraph 10 .
we clearly expect a political stance to be take with a very firm deadline of the preparation for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund.We therefore demand , if this motion be adopt tomorrow , that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell u what position they will take on this occasion .
Madam President , my Group be extremely delighted that this debate be take place today , particularly a we have spar no effort along with Members of other group to bring this about .
obviously we all have different approach which be demonstrate by our debate and the motion for a resolution table at the beginning .
have say this , our Group be please about the step forward which the compromise motion represents.This invite the Commission to present a report within six month .
the European Parliament can play it role by take the initiative , even if it do so timidly , on this subject.However , I agree with the previous speaker that , if paragraph 9 be challenge , this motion would clearly lose it substance .
USD 1 800 billion be the volume of money move every day in the world & apos ; s currency markets.This represent over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in good and service .
by put finance at the helm , this have reinforce the demand of profitability and toughen the operating condition everywhere .
it have lead to a growth in merger , acquisition and company restructuring and to gigantic sum be raise with increase frequency on the financial market .
unemployment and pressure on employee worldwide be increase .
opening and real growth be be hamper and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital be threaten the economy of many country , to the point of collapse , a in Asia , Russia and Brazil .
face with this neoliberal globalisation dominate by the financial market , demand , a our motion recognises , be develop from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulate a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world .
no one can ignore the challenge to civilisation pose by the lack of nearly one billion job and the need to make unprecedented effort in term of development and access to information .
in this respect , all idea deserve to be consider , include the Tobin tax which be important , just like other form of transaction which may be envisage .
this tax could help to check speculation without penalise the activity of the real economy.It could release new resource for investment in people and , at a time when the UNDP estimate the sum need to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year , it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health need .
when the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics go global , the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbol of the political desire to recapture the democratic area seize by the international financial operator .
the Commissioner have say that a minimum number of industrialised country would be need to achieve this .
I would point out that the European Union be compose of a large number of industrialised country and , like Mr Désir and several other speaker , I feel that the European Union which we be form can take the initiative in this respect .
in any case , the European Parliament would be honour to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone .
Madam President , I too be delighted that we be have this debate.I only regret that it have be so long in come .
we know that each generation have , over the course of time , blindly buy into what could be call a dominant ideology.This be a set of prejudice accept a such due to a general conformism , but whose dramatic nature can be see by subsequent generation .
free trade and the constant worship of globalisation be now the dominant ideology or , rather , the big mistake of our fin de siècle.This ideology be a dangerous a the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridor of the Kremlin or , before that , the certainty , elevate to the status of a dogma , that the earth be flat .
our world be now dominate by a single logic or , I could say , a single god of money at work instead of people at work .
with a figure for trade in good and service of FRF 36 000 billion only be equal to the product of four day & apos ; speculation , the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individual .
it be natural that these élites would exclude any political concern from their field of manoeuvre , thus protect themselves from any democratic control and basically manage to be both illegitimate and irresponsible .
however , the people be fight back , a demonstrate by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit.The leader of the world , head unfortunately by the European Commission , rush forward submissively , hop that their docility at the foot of the master of the world , Mr Clinton , would be enough to ensure them the scrap from the table .
yet they reckon without the salutary reaction of the nobody , both individual and States.This reaction be more organised than previously , due in France particularly to the magnificent ATTAC network which be fight with increase support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transaction in particular .
the creation of this taxation , of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type propose by Professor Lauré , could prove to be politically opportune , at least due to it symbolism rather than it low rate.This be because it would basically mean that politics be regain a foothold in an area from which it have be exclude by operator whose profit be proportional to the degree of resignation of States .
Madam President , although some of the aim of the Tobin tax be fairly worthy of support , introduce the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union , a the first area of the world to do so , would sound the death knell for the European currency market .
if the world & apos ; s other important currency trade area be to be exclude from the Tobin tax , the fact that tax be liable to be pay in Europe would lead to currency deal move to those area .
this have already be make clear a number time in this debate .
it be not enough that all the world & apos ; s industrialised country should be include in the scheme , a then currency trading would move to tax haven outside that group of country .
there should therefore be a universal application : it be not enough that the G7 country or the other industrialised country be involve .
on the other hand , it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speak , I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax dream might a well be bury .
furthermore , although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme , the question would remain regard how the tax revenue would be distribute .
the world & apos ; s currency deal centre will hardly agree to the tax revenue be use , for example , for a variety of well-meaning , UN-backed purpose throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remain with them .
with regard to the Tobin tax a a mean of prevent future currency crisis , it have to be realise that the cause of a currency be overvalue can not be avert through taxation .
for that reason , a Mr Karas also say , we should give more attention to the policy that lead to a certain currency be overvalue in relation to it actual potential value .
this again would require measure to regulate the exportation and importation of capital ; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policy in this way .
although it seem a reasonable scheme , the Tobin tax be not without it problem , even if there should be agreement a to it implementation , which I do not believe there will .
it have to be remember that money at present be first and foremost information , and that the global economy will , in the future , rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital .
for that reason , the uninterrupted flow of asset in massive volume between the world & apos ; s financial centre be not merely speculative activity , which have nothing to do with the real economy .
if this & apos ; feedback & apos ; mechanism , which give user the opportunity to make choice , be hamper by measure such a the Tobin tax , mistake decision might be make that turn out to be so costly in term of the economic consequence that the tax would never be able to make up for it .
hence , a Mr Karas have state to his credit , our Group be resolutely oppose to the introduction of the Tobin tax .
Madam President , I speak a someone who be in support of a tax on speculative capital movement across currency border .
it seem to me blindingly self-evident that some action be necessary .
the size , unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange market have make it harder and harder to manage national and regional economy .
Computer-controlled selling programme turn a random blip into an avalanche , bury job , life and industry across the globe .
the only argument against it be : firstly , it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzy we have see that have destroy job throughout the world , in East Asia , Europe and Latin America .
Mr Chirac have describe those who engage in this a the Aids virus of the world economy .
what be necessary be to throw some sand into the wheel of the currency speculator , stockbroker and option trader .
of course , this can not be do in one country ; it can not be do within the single currency area , but it could be do at international level with global cooperation .
Europe , Japan and the US - the euro , the yen and the dollar , would constitute , in my opinion , such a block .
I be disappoint in the EPP .
I think at least they read the resolution they be go to vote on .
yes , I be in favour of such a tax , but it be not what we be go to vote on tomorrow .
what we be go to vote on tomorrow be to ask the Commission to study the matter , to look at what step and what condition would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax .
equally I understand the Commissioner fail to endorse such a tax , but I can not understand why he fail to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue .
there be nothing so close a a closed mind .
the tax have the support of 47 % of the people in the UK , accord to a recent survey by War on Want .
in France it have have enormous resonance , particularly when link to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of it debt and poverty .
this issue can no longer be ignore by Parliament , the Council or the Commission .
there be now a weight of public opinion demand an answer more sophisticated than : & quot ; it have not be do before & quot ; .
in the new millennium , with new global problem require new global solution , they need to give good argument why it can not be do now , rather than why it have not be do in the past .
Madam President , Commissioner , a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flow would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rule .
I have two or three point to make in this respect .
one of the main demand of the demonstrator in Seattle be , rightly , the establishment of this type of tax , and this be not by chance .
the proposal of this tax today send out a strong signal from the rich European country prove that they want to move away from the culture of egoism .
everyone feel that this kind of joint tax be a virtuous measure which do not prevent trade but be aim primarily at speculation and it perverse effects.The Members on the right should note this .
it symbolise the need for solidarity with the country of the south , particularly those in Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific which question u extensively on this subject in Seattle .
in order to fully achieve it objective , the money supply release by such a tax must be redistribute among the poorest country .
this be how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rule and show solidarity with the people of the south .
Madam President , we can not just keep repeat the number which several previous speaker have quote ; we must also mention the fact , Commissioner , that 80 % of these huge , daily foreign exchange sale have an investment term of no more than eight day .
we can not maintain a situation in which investment and the creation of job be le lucrative than short-term sale of foreign currency and share .
we can not maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action .
we can not maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activity increase more and more quickly .
it have be demonstrate in Germany that income from monetary asset have almost double from 7.6 % of overall economic income since Tobin develop his idea .
we can not maintain a situation in which the poorest country of the world be most expose to the speculative argument surround short-term currency fluctuation .
nor do I believe that this be impracticable .
why should it not be possible for the G7 country , the other EU Member States , China , Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax ?
there must be an overriding economic interest .
why should it be impracticable , and it can be differentiate , to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transaction , all the so-called cash transaction , currency future and option ?
why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which do not jeopardise the long-term investment need by the economy but which finally make short-term and speculative investment unattractive .
numerous very difficult question be bind to arise , but the only real problem which I can see so far be one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shift responsibility from one agency to another which have now take hold .
Madam President , we be not ask for more bureaucracy , a Mr Karas put it just a few minute ago .
we be look for solution .
of course capital market need clarity - that be actually the idea .
the Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question .
& quot ; the more progress be make towards trade liberalisation , the more rule be need & quot ; , a Commissioner Lamy say during the Millennium Round in Seattle .
he recognise that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union & apos ; s construction be intimately link to a huge amount of new regulation .
now that financing be readily available across national boundary without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary , all the more so a we consider that an enormous amount every single day be employ in speculative transaction .
we citizen of the world can not afford the current rate of speculation .
to continue would be economic suicide .
honourable Members , Commissioner , it be often say that Europe have succeed in stabilise the economic sector , but this be only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector .
if we look at the private sector , however , we will find not only that this fabled & apos ; financial stability & apos ; have be unsuccessful but that we be most probably sit on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment .
the debt burden of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of Stock Exchange security , the two main market stability indicator , have , for some time , be at danger level , a the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly illustrate .
the fact that the public accepts such rate and do not just abandon all financial activity in a panic can be explain by overambitious expectation over future gain .
speculative activity be grow beyond measure and be , in turn , generate profit which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious .
Over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear , which , in turn , will result in a stock market and economic crisis .
the danger be too great for u to ignore .
we ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem .
modern economic science have provide an exceptional instrument with the Tobin proposal and others , which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start .
that be what we be lack , Commissioner : the political will to make a start in tackle speculation .
no longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of , or for this fatalist approach towards , market force a adopt by the liberal - and I be sorry that Mr Gasòliba I Böhm have leave - a this will only lead to it ruin .
Madam President , Mr Bolkestein , the ignorance surround this debate be unbelievable .
we need a Greek Member to finally tell u what this Tobin tax mean .
you reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it .
that the Right oppose tax be quite understandable , except that they should never have be allow to spirit their million , or rather billion , into Switzerland .
we all know that !
but now I call on you , in all consciousness , to help put a stop to speculative financial transaction and undermine long-term project with long-term capital .
it have never be do in south-east Asia , it have never be do in Europe , and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria have leave the chamber , give Austria & apos ; s financial record .
they be all tar with the same dirty brush !
we need a Tobin tax to give u a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene .
Madam President , I be totally appal by the Commission & apos ; s , i.e . Mr Bolkestein & apos ; s , political ignorance !
he should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he be here at all !
Madam President , I too have find part of the debate quite bizarre .
it be perhaps not by chance that the Conservative bench have empty because that which be represent a market freedom no longer have anything in common with the noble principle of the social market economy which have bring so much prosperity to u here in western Europe over recent decade .
if we continue down this path , and this be the ideology , and declare the financial market to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the working of these market be contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy , then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportion .
those who own the monetary asset be currently amass huge fortune which be again scream out to be reinvested .
we have asset inflation of global proportion .
a a result , speculative bubble continually arise on the financial market , cause grow economic instability which , in turn , jeopardise the entire economy .
and it be precisely the medium-sized undertaking and large number of employee who suffer a a result .
we can take action against this ; it be possible .
the minimum requirement for this would be for a proper study to be carry out at long last , not only by the Commission , but by reputable economic institute throughout Europe .
that too be feasible .
and then perhaps everyone will stop bandy about argument which be ask for trouble !
it be not correct that the Tobin tax be technically impracticable - it be quite feasible in the age of the computer .
the fact that tax haven be frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European bank here at home must not be ignore .
in short , we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other , because otherwise we shall be steer towards situation which we experience on this continent time and again during the last century and which have catastrophic result .
Madam President , let u indeed tax money speculation : it do not produce anything new .
the tax would be target at the right place : at the speculator .
who be go to defend these speculator , when nurse and teacher be pay top rate of tax ?
Article 73 c of the Treaty establish the European Union provide scope for taxation on transaction .
those who oppose taxation on currency deal be in favour of those tax-recycling centre , the tax havens , of which there be 62 in all .
the Union should make a tax pact , which any country could initially be party to .
the low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problem .
it be strange to claim that if everyone be not include it would be impossible to bring into effect .
the European Union be found through the effort of just a few country , and you see how we be today .
the truth be the greatest problem be a political one : they do not want to tax capital , but raise personal taxation instead .
in the end tax would politicise the global , undemocratic system of financial power .
lady and gentleman , we must challenge the monopoly the world & apos ; s speculative elite have on plan the world & apos ; s economy by remain outside the tax system .
Madam President , may I begin by extend a heartfelt thanks to all speaker and , above all of course , Mr Désir , for the fact that this debate be take place this evening .
whatever one may think about the topic of debate , it be evident that it be an important one .
this be why it have be around for year , and it be satisfy that the Commission be be afford the opportunity this evening to give a response .
I would like to start by underline two remark make by the Member of your Parliament , Mr Gasòliba .
he say that globalisation be a positive phenomenon , and I share his view .
I believe that globalisation have help many country which , so far , have be on the sideline of the world trade stream to participate in these and be incorporate into the world trade system and , a far a I be aware , no country have ever be worse off by participate in international trade .
in other word , a indeed already remark by Mr Gasòliba , globalisation be , in my view , positive , and I be of the opinion that it have contribute to a new international distribution of labour which have be pursue by many people for many year .
a second remark make by Mr Gasòliba be that there be currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rate .
I think that he be correct in this regard .
I too be not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transaction would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rate .
I be of the opinion that these be two important remark , and that be why I be reiterate them here .
Madam President , could I furthermore point out that none of the speaker this evening have draw a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other ?
surely we be all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedom be the freedom of capital movement .
Madam President , I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consist partly of attempt , in conjunction with my office and colleague , to completely integrate the financial market within Europe , thus enable financial transaction to run a easily and smoothly a possible .
in my capacity a Commissioner for the Internal Market , I be , in other word , oppose to all measure which hamper international financial transaction .
you could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would , in fact , impede international economic movement .
once again , the Tobin tax be , in my view , at odds with the Treaty of Rome , and this be an important , theoretical objection which have not be consider by any of the speaker this evening .
Madam President , apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observation , there be also practical objection to the Tobin tax , a already underline by Mr Karas and other speaker .
it have unfortunately be observe , I have to say , that the European Union have fail to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures.This indicate how difficult these dossier be .
if we have not be able to reach agreement internally , I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partner .
I think that this will be problematic .
Madam President , Mr Jonckheer have state that this could be one of the measure for stabilise the financial market .
I think , however , that instability be merely a symptom and that we should be look at the underlie causes.I think that it be preferable to fight the cause rather than attempt to tackle the symptom when this be probably not possible and when , a already state , the measure concern be pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome .
in order to remove these cause , one have to look at what be happen in the country in question .
be it the case that these country can boast of what be term in English & apos ; good governance & apos ; ?
be it the case that there be low inflation and that there be low interest rate ?
that the market for production factor , include the labour market , operate flexibly ?
that be not always the case .
so if we want to look into what cause exchange rate instability , then we need to take into account the element of good governance and focus on these first .
in addition - and this have also be mention already , for example by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm , but also by others - there be a need for more supervision .
more supervision nationally - supervision by national government of national bank - and internationally , for example by mean of the IMF .
so I believe the best way to tackle the cause be by ensure , on the one hand , that good governance be observe in the country in question and that , on the other hand , there be more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapse .
Madam President , accord to various Members of your Parliament , more funding should still be make available for major project .
for example , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler speak in English about & apos ; long-term capital for long-term project & apos ; - this be an obvious issue .
Madam President , I should like to leave it here.As far a the resolution be concern , of which I have see a draft , the Commission will await the vote and will , base on this , determine it stance .
I thank you for give me the opportunity to take part in this debate .
I have receive four motion for a resolution , table pursuant to Rule 40 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
Madam President , unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language .
but I would be oblige if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute , which I think he can not do at the same time a talk to Mrs Randzio-Plath .
could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him ?
Monsieur Bolkestein , je veux vous dire quelque chose !
unfortunately , my Dutch be not a good a yours .
but I would rather like to say something else to you .
Parliament be not take the initiative and support a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission .
we want to examine the possibility of introduce a Tobin tax .
it will be just one of several instrument and hopefully you will be on our side in this .
from a political point of view , I always fret when people say , we neither need , want nor can we achieve these thing !
it be not your job , it be our job to decide on that .
it also have something to do with the newly awake self-consciousness of this Parliament .
I just want to discuss it with you , no more and no le .
we can do so without go off at other tangents.I respect you a a serious Commissioner who want to take his work seriously .
please respect u a Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously , and that include the Tobin tax !
Madam President , an omission appear to have be made.In the list of tabled motion for a resolution which you have just read out , no mention be make of the compromise motion table jointly by the PSE , ELDR , GUE / NGL and Greens / EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux .
Mr Désir , I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution .
if the service of the Presidency confirm that this be correctly table , it will be include .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m .
( the sitting be close at 8.14 p.m . )
adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Mr President , I simply want to pass on some news.There be a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid .
someone plant a car bomb and one person have die .
on behalf of my Group , I once again condemn these terrorist act .
thank you , Mrs Fraga Estévez .
we have hear about this regrettable incident .
unfortunately , the terrorist murderer be once again punish Spanish society.I note your comment with particular keenness , a you may expect , give that I too be Spanish .
( the Minutes be approve )
resumption of the session
I declare resume the session of the European Parliament adjourn on Friday , 21 January 2000 .
Madam President , allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy .
two year ago , in Cavalese in Italy , an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cable of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceed safe limit , cause the death of more than 20 Europeans .
since then , the victim & apos ; family , who have not have the consolation of justice , since the pilot responsible have not face criminal charge , have be await solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least .
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authority , and this be in order to uphold the right of the victim & apos ; family .
Mrs Angelilli , thank you.I have take note of your comment .
agenda
the next item be the order of business .
if you decide to add this debate to the agenda , it will be introduce by speech from Mr Seixas da Costa , President-in-Office of the Council , and Mr Romano Prodi , President of the Commission .
be there anyone who wish to speak in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents , and , since I publicly criticise the presidency in January , I would like to take this opportunity to say , both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group , that we now find the presidency & apos ; s statement on this issue to be appropriate , and we agree on their basis , their importance and their form .
Madam President , it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which be more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure .
this debate be topical , exceptionally important and urgent .
we therefore believe that the agenda should be amend to include it .
( applause )
be there anyone who wish to speak against this proposal ?
Madam President , I shall speak against this proposal on the ground of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the Treaties , and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Madam President , until now we believe that the European Union be , accord to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris found the European Communities , and subsequently the Union , an association of free , independent , sovereign state .
even though many development cast doubt on this , we do believe , in spite of everything , that this be the case and , more recently , reference be make , albeit half-heartedly , to the principle of subsidiarity .
if you ratify ...
Mr Gollnisch , excuse me , you have one minute .
I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure be observe .
Madam President , I think I have three minute .
do forgive me .
if you ratify this development , then you be ratify the development of the Union into a body which violate the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States , and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union .
we have hear one speaker in favour and one against .
I shall now , therefore , put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote .
( Parliament give it assent )
this debate be therefore add at the top of the order of business .
topical AND URGENT DEBATE
the next item be the debate on topical and urgent subject of major importance .
talk in Austria on form a government
the next item be the debate on the talk in Austria on form a government .
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Seixas da Costa , President-in-Office of the Council .
Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , the Group of the Party of European Socialists hop that this debate will send three message to the European public .
let it be note that we be completely unite on all three count .
firstly , we wish to express our total support for , and our solidarity with , the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States , because we believe that this statement be in accordance with the common value , and not just the political force , which we have all build together .
in any event , these common value be in complete opposition to those hold by the party ironically know a the Austrian Freedom Party .
the Europe we be build be bear of the bitter experience we have all suffer , and the Socialist Group condemn the insult which have be direct at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government , but also at the Socialists , who be European citizen a well , because , at the moment , the Austrian Socialists be be describe a traitor to their country .
I will say one thing.For many year I be a traitor to my country ; at least that be General Franco & apos ; s view .
President Guterres be also a traitor in Salazar & apos ; s eye , and that be something that I believe should also be state and defend by the PPE-DE .
I also believe that the Commission , or President Prodi , have act a a guardian of the Treaties .
however , I would remind him that , during his inaugural debate , he describe the Commission a a European government .
a government must have more nerve and more courage .
that be what I be ask President Prodi for at this moment .
( applause )
with all due respect to a Commissioner a effective a Mr Fischler , and give that we have hear contradictory comment , depend on the translation , with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler , I would be very grateful if this point could be clarify in this House .
secondly , Madam President , we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people .
this be an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not vote for Haider , who have vote for the clearly democratic option , commit to Europe , and I must point out that Mr Schüssel may have be Minister for Finance , but Chancellor Vranitzky also contribute to Austria & apos ; s integration process .
we should not be so politically partisan .
the accession of Austria to the Community be a joint venture .
we all take part in it , not just one group .
therefore , Madam President , I believe that it be our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect , because this type of menace , which we have suffer before in Europe , may not only harm Austria , but it may also spread , and I say this bearing history in mind .
therefore , apart from the apology which Mr Schüssel have make , offer u all kind of guarantee , a do Chamberlain and Daladier in 1938 in Munich , I would like to know whether the PPE intend to implement measure in relation to the Austrian People & apos ; s Party , if it go ahead with this mad project .
thirdly , if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance , I can assure you that we can forget the European Union & apos ; s main objective - enlargement - because , if we be Czechs , Slovenes or Hungarians , what would we say , face with a neighbour who judge u on racial ground and do not want u to enter ?
I therefore think that this be a great day for European politics to commence .
we support the Council and we believe that it be our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option .
( applause from the PSE Group )
Madam President , we could have be debate the need to reinforce the founding principle of the Union , so that we can uphold them together .
instead , we have be force to debate the formal , substantial error that have be make in the last few day .
we be astonish by the political naivety of people who , with thoughtless word , have bolster Mr Haider & apos ; s position in Austria and make the Union look ridiculous , rid roughshod over Article 7 of the Treaty by announce unconstitutional measure .
we have never before see such serious , clumsy interference in the internal affair of a Member State .
of course , we can not violate the found value of Europe , and in this regard , the Italian Prime Minister state that these principle be include in a treaty : he mention the Treaty of Copenhagen , which I , like you , have never hear of because it do not exist .
maybe he be refer to the Treaty of Amsterdam , Article 6 of which list certain principle and Article 7 certain procedure , in order to establish that a Member State be seriously and continuously violate the principle refer to in Article 6 .
however , up till now , Austria have commit no serious or persistent violation .
apart from amount to interference , the statement by the Presidency be discriminatory because it authorise the penalisation of a population and deny these people their right to choose who to vote for .
no political cohesion have so far come about , not even in the fight against organise crime , or in defence of the victim of genocide ; we do not have a currency that be even remotely stable or an economy which really do combat unemployment and poverty ; but it only take one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union & apos ; s credibility .
sanction can be impose after the Treaties have be violate , but can not be apply if a democratically elect party enters government .
otherwise , how will we deal with Communist country which return to Communism : will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government , or will Stalin & apos ; s grandchild be forgive for everything ?
( applause from the right ) It be via diplomacy , persuasion , knowledge , and solidarity , and not with threat or via anti-constitutional mean that the institution can ensure respect for themselves and for principle .
bilateral relation involve the States , so the 14 do not come into this .
this be rid roughshod over the European institution in order to defend political way of thinking , with an incompetence worthy of party which have just emerge from totalitarian regimes.It be not what you would expect of the representative of democratic tradition .
so many thing set u apart from Mr Haider - a we have often write - include his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region .
however , we already know this .
however , today we be concern to learn that other representative of the Union seem to have turn their back on the Union & apos ; s democratic role .
we support legality and democracy a express by the people , and favour uphold national sovereignty a long a this do not violate the principle of the Treaty or human right .
we believe in Europe , while it seem that others have start the process of break up the Union .
this be what have come of rush headlong into enlargement and not clearly define role and task .
we have build a Europe with an unstable market , not a Europe with principle , right and politics .
and these be the consequence !
therefore , we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who be work to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people , thereby ensure that this people retain it freedom and maintains good relation with other people .
Madam President , today we have an appointment with hypocrisy .
here we have a Council which have manage to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach .
in the event there be absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria .
there be risk , a we be all aware , but in the event there be absolutely no serious and persistent breach .
if we be to apply the criterion of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criterion to the European Union , then , most certainly , this European Union could not become a member , although the country of Eastern Europe be require to meet them .
and if we be to speak of serious and persistent breach , then perhaps we could mention some Member States , such a Italy and France , first and third , respectively , in the list of country condemn by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court .
we could mention , my Belgian friend , Belgium and the Dutroux case , the dozen upon dozen of child kidnap , torture , rap and murder by lead personality in this country , where inquiry be bogged down , make no headway .
we could , if one third of the Members of Parliament so request , require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter .
we could ask ourselves why the Austrians be reject 10 year , 13 year of party politics which have make one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten , just a it be now corrupt country such a Italy , Belgium and other European Union Member States .
we might well wonder why 76 % of Belgian citizen have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56 % of French citizen have no confidence in their country & apos ; s system of justice , and 53 % of Italian citizen have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice ...
( the President cut the speaker off )
Madame President , my group , the EDD , and especially my party , be very concern by this debate .
we can not , and we do not , support in any way the sentiment and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his reference to the Third Reich .
we also , however , deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfere in the policy of an elected government of any country , especially one which be part of the European Union .
my party at home be certainly not racist , but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well .
be you go to interfere with Great Britain & apos ; s Parliament if we be elect ?
Madame President , the people of Austria have speak by elect Herr Haider to their Parliament .
I believe they give him 28 % of the vote so there be go to be a coalition government .
your Parliament , may I suggest , Madame President , should wait to see if the party of Haider have an effect on the policy of that country .
then , and only then , might you consider if human right be affect .
your Parliament may consider measure appropriate to counter that situation and then , Madame President and only then , may your Parliament consider interfere in the constitutional affair of a country of the European Union .
Madam President , a a representative of the Freedom Party , I respect the concern some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic development in Austria .
my reaction may come a a surprise when I say that I personally be at a loss a to the heighten sensitivity display towards Austria in matter of respect for human right , have a sense of responsibility for one & apos ; s own past , and the stability of democracy .
Austria must take the responsibility on it own shoulder for the often dubious image other country tend to have of it , rightly or wrongly .
the refusal of our government , down through the year , to acknowledge our complicity in the horror of the Second World War , together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victim and those force into hard labour , have do a great deal to bolster this negative image .
this FPÖ have now enter into a coalition with the ÖVP , due to the outcome of election hold on 3 October 1999 , when the previous government be vote out of office .
this be the citizen of a state & apos ; s prerogative , for it be the found principle of a democracy .
when the talk between the SPÖ and ÖVP break down , the Socialists attempt to form a minority government and ask the FPÖ for their support .
we be offer three ministerial post - you can read it for yourself in the newspaper - the very party that be be denounce a fascistic here !
when we suddenly refuse this offer , an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign begin that be beyond our comprehension to this day .
the FPÖ party be establish in Austria & apos ; s political landscape .
the head of the government of one of the nine province belong to this party and it be involve in all the other provincial government .
what many Austrians be wonder today be why their democratic decision have suddenly be interpret a an expression of a fascistic cast of mind , and why the campaign do not begin until the Freedom Party reject the support of a minority government comprise the SPÖ ?
there be prejudice at work here , which - without go into our programme - be reduce the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle .
I be fill with disgust when certain of our opponent get mileage out of the million of death that take place in the gas chamber of the concentration camp a cheap propaganda , a , for example , the Italian MEP Bertinotti do yesterday on Italian TV when he accuse Mr Haider of deny the holocaust .
shame on you Mr Bertinotti !
you might have run out of political argument but that do not give you the right to use those who be murder a cheap propaganda .
denounce a democratically elect politician a a Nazi do not make you an anti-fascist !
on the contrary , you be deride the true victim of National Socialism and play down what the fascist dictator do .
your behaviour stem from your own prejudice , you be dispense with any form of political debate and you be display precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose .
the attack against Austria & apos ; s new government and the attempt to exert political influence in a Member State be an insult to the Austrian people .
that be why we be indebted to the Commission for take a stance that separate it from the rest .
the new coalition agreement be about reform a democracy , the right of the opposition , commitment to compensate those force into hard labour ....
( the President cut the speaker off )
Madam President , to begin with , I would like to make one thing abundantly clear : Austria be not in danger of experience a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion .
Austria be a stable democracy ; one in which human right and fundamental freedom be guarantee under the constitution and be afford the protection of an independent judiciary .
Austria be a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there .
there be nothing unusual about what be happen in Austria : there have be a changeover of power follow democratic election , in consequence of which an old system be vote out and a stable parliamentary majority prepare to carry out the necessary economic and social reform be seek and find .
there will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition .
the Austrian People & apos ; s Party , which I represent here in this Parliament , use to be and still be a party that have consistently speak up for the integration of my country into the EU and feel deeply attach to the community of value that be the European Union , and likewise it basic political principle of deepen and enlargement .
we respect and accept the discussion that be take place and also appreciate the concern that be be voice in many of our Member States a to the way ahead for Austria .
our understanding spring from the knowledge that our history of the recent past have bequeath to u a political responsibility of special importance in the present .
our country be not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship , many people be perpetrator too , although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt .
the ÖVP play no small part in help Austria find it way into the European Union .
my country & apos ; s place be not outside the European Union but in it ...
... , with all the right and commitment that this entail !
any future government must therefore be judge accord to the value and principle it profess to in it manifesto , and not accord to the prejudgement put about both by political adversary and the international medium .
a declared belief in human right , democracy and the rule of law , in an honest reappraisal of Austria & apos ; s role in the past , in pass on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century , the holocaust , will also be reflect in the fundamental accord underlie a future coalition government between the ÖVP and FPÖ .
my party can be rely upon to see to it that my country hold firm to the course of European politics and continue to be root in the European community of value !
( applause )
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Representatives of the Commission , it be a black day for Austria and for Europe .
not even Mr Sichrovsky & apos ; s web of lie or Mrs Stenzel & apos ; s word of appeasement can do anything to change that .
for the day have dawn : two irresponsible politician , consume with a lust for power , be sell Austria & apos ; s image , political role , and to some extent even it economic interest , down the river !
( applause , heckle )
they be trade this in for a head of government & apos ; s position and for membership of a government .
they be just a prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from be a revered country to a reviled one , a they be it threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of it citizen .
I believe - a do many who for year have campaign against Haider and his brand of politics , and especially my colleague in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measure announce by the international community , insofar a they do not have any bearing on the government and it representative , be grave and also inappropriate .
however , my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage , be direct exclusively against those who have provoke these reaction and continue to do so , Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their party , ...
... and that include their representative in this Parliament .
Mr Poettering , it be interest to note that you be in almost a difficult a position a I be , albeit for different reason , for you be have to defend something that go against your conviction .
you be have to defend a certain Mr Schüssel , you be have to consort with Schüssel a he be today and who , a I understand it , be recently tell not to come to the representative of the Christian Democratic party & apos ; s summit meeting .
the argument that Mr Poettering himself use have come into play , i.e . that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he be to be integrate into the political system .
however , in my view , he will be no more able or willing to be integrate into this , into our political system , and into the Europe of today , than any other extreme right-wing movement .
anyone who feed on prejudice towards foreigner and ethnic minority and give succour to these prejudice , whose programme feature parochialism and anti-liberalism , who display loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relation , and who have never yet distance themselves clearly and unequivocally from National Socialism , have neither the intention nor inclination to integrate !
( applause )
this historic weight of guilt fall on the shoulder of the Conservatives for have consort with the wolf of their own free will and wait to be devour .
that be how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the ÖVP - be sustain rather than keep in check .
I understand that Europe and the civilised world want to have a little a possible to do with such a government .
however , by the same token , there be another Austria , the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrate against the FPÖ have any involvement in government , and who will continue to demonstrate against this government .
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria !
( applause )
the more powerful this Europe become and the more vigilant it be towards authoritarian tendency in the Europe of today , the more successful we will be in strike at the root of right-wing extremism .
for Europe be and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy , or even against a relapse into barbarism .
please support the Austrian people against this government !
( applause )
Madam President , this be an historic moment , a it be now , at last , quite clear to u all that the European Union have gradually develop into a community of value .
we see this , now that the government of one Member State be be join by a party which , a be know , do not respect all these value .
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen state emanate from the Council be justify , a in a way this be also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union , mean this be also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria & apos ; s .
a Members of Parliament , we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begin to establish fundamental right be more important than ever .
it be more important than ever that respect for , and non-violation of , human value and the right of minority , include the right of all those who live within the territory of the European Union , form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU , and , for this reason , the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be make legally bind .
it must not be allow to remain a mere declaration .
a important be the fact that Austria & apos ; s force of democracy should be give support , a none of u wish to isolate the country .
we know that most Austrians respect these value .
they have also show how they feel : not all the demonstration have take place outside Austria .
doubtless there be also a lot of protest voter on the scene that have want a change in Austrian policy for a long time .
I believe Parliament should support these force of democracy .
I also appeal to the Austrian President , that he might yet look into all the possibility for form a government make up of democratic force .
Madam President , I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group , Francis Wurtz , remind u of just now .
I welcome the statement by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 country which have reject official contact with an Austrian Government that include Jörg Haider & apos ; s party .
the fact that we be stress this be all the more important because , a you know , we essentially disagree with the policy make by Europe , with it economic and social policy , it democratic deficit and the Member States & apos ; involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans .
our normal disagreement further emphasise our appreciation today : this be extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational , neo-nazi element in Europe be extraordinary .
this danger do not concern Austria , it concern Europe .
we be talk about u , not Austria .
we know the social cause which contribute , along with unemployment and instability , to fuel tendency towards this ; we know the accompany cultural cause - xenophobia , racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing group to settle account with nazism , we can not fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture be create in Europe .
not only the Alpine region , but all our country be involve : the condition be be create whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat .
the position take by the presidency have show that it be aware of this tragedy for civilisation .
Europe be show that it have not forget Auschwitz ;
Europe be come face to face with the suffering of the past .
now , though , it should follow through with it action , and the first to follow through should be the Commission , which , however , have be obscure and weak on this , make the value of the presidency & apos ; s position even more apparent .
this be the change we must impose on the Commission & apos ; s action .
Madam President , despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human right and the freedom and sovereignty of people , which oppose fascism , nazism or communism , both new and old , and despite all the previous speaker talk about the sovereignty of the Austrian people , we be today witness this sovereignty be deny by Parliament .
in the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party , there be nothing to justify the accusation that it be attack the principle of freedom , democracy and respect for human right , fundamental freedom or the rule of law , enshrine in Article 6 of the Treaties .
I would , however , like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office , who have be so critical of Austria , have recently consign the inhabitant of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People & apos ; s Democratic Republic of China .
perhaps , in order to strengthen the Union & apos ; s democracy , it would now be appropriate to isolate Austria and criminalise a party that be democratically elect by the Austrian citizen , while bring Turkey and it & quot ; Grey Wolves & quot ; into Europe .
Madam President , we be debate an extremely serious issue .
we be debate nothing le than the presence in a Member State & apos ; s government of a political force whose doctrine and principle be incompatible with the conceptual and moral base of the Union enshrine in it founding Treaties .
a simple reading of chapter 4 , article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party & apos ; s manifesto be enough to make any democratic conscience shudder .
the view that ethnicity be the define factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group have superiority over others , a be write here , revive old ghost of the century which we have just leave behind , which some historian have describe a the century of horror ; horror which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider & apos ; s manifesto have stir up once again , to our amazement .
of course Austria be a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affair of a Member State .
however , that be not the problem .
the question be whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which include such a party .
our answer to this crucial question be no .
leave aside strategic and tactical consideration , leave aside possible exoneration base on other people & apos ; s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interest , the Spanish delegation of the People & apos ; s Group of this Parliament , in full agreement with the Spanish People & apos ; s Party and the Spanish Government , clearly express it full agreement with the statement of 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council .
we agree with it substance , it tone and it scope .
( applause )
Konrad Adenauer once say - and he know what he be say - that the surest way to pacify a tiger be to allow it to devour you .
history be a compendium of event which could have be avoid .
therefore , Madam President , the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message , rejecting of the tiger of intolerance , xenophobia and totalitarianism , so a not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdication , renunciation and opportunism which mark Europe & apos ; s past and for which we have pay such a heavy price .
( loud applause )
Madam President , the European Union be build upon the idea & apos ; never again & apos ; , mean never again do we want to see xenophobia , concentration camp , anti-Semitism , heighten nationalism or war .
the one and only significance of the European Union be the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which give the coup de grâce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe , and which be still highly topical today .
it be not true to say that , when a government form an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe , this be merely a question of national sovereignty .
for this Union of ours be not a grouping of neighbour nation state who be simply come to mutual arrangement to improve their collective circumstance .
it be a Community that be destine to exist , in which , when the main thing be under threat , when value be under threat , all democrat must bend over backwards to find solution to ensure that the mistake of the past be never make again .
let u learn the lesson of the past .
in the thirty , when Adolf Hitler be democratically elect , although with a minority , many people think that it be not a bad a all that and , Mr Poettering , in France , a number of men and woman , on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasion too , think , & apos ; Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire . & apos ;
they put their own petty squabble first , and the rest be history .
we must make a rapid , strong and united response .
I would have like to hear your discussion with the Austrian President , Mr Poettering.We be well aware that he be very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government have do in form such an alliance .
so our response must be rapid and strong .
of course , the Treaty provide u with a barrier when thing become intolerable ; I be almost go to say & apos ; irreparable & apos ; .
history have teach u that Fascists start to blow hot and cold : use heat word first , in populist , xenophobic speech , and then cool word in order to make themselves acceptable to institution and to infiltrate them gradually , poison them , until the day they start to take action .
and when that day come , it be too late .
so our Treaty have make provision for barrier for the time when it be too late , but we be not at that point : today we have to take step to ensure that we do not get to that point .
we must therefore find a political solution .
I support the Council proposal in this , while deplore a certain lack of strength , a certain spinelessness , on the part of the Commission which will , however , have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis , with determination over time , since Fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy , they count on time to wear u down and they hope to impose their view in the end .
our response must be rapid .
if today we do not staunchly support the Council , then history will judge u , say that we achieve the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement .
Madam President , I be pleased about the fact that , in Austria , the will of the large majority of the people be be respect and that this formation of government constitutes , in my eye , a huge victory for democracy .
let there be no doubt about it : we decline with thanks a Europe which develop into a kind of & quot ; big brother & quot ; and which keep watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and use Stalinist method .
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lesson from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embrace corrupt party finance by arm dealer and that appoint the leader of such a corrupt party , which be condemn by the court , to the post of European Commissioner .
today , we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which be important to all nation within Europe and to anyone who feel particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech .
Madam President , this debate be open by Mr Da Costa , who merely confirm that the EU presidency be try to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States .
this debate , and the background to it , reinforce the point that the Council , the Commission and this Parliament itself be dominate by Socialists .
my delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy , programme and tone of Austria & apos ; s Freedom Party .
we share the widespread outrage at it attitude to history , in particular World War II , but also it policy on enlargement , on immigration , on race and it attitude to the European Union itself .
we be also outrage , however , at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny , the terror and the excess of the former USSR .
even today , surely it be high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal link with China & apos ; s Communist Party .
not a word be say by these same EU government about coalition government involve fellow-travelling communist in French or Italian government , or in German state government , or even the British government & apos ; s willingness to promote those with terrorist association a minister in Northern Ireland today .
this , Madam President , be the hypocrisy of the left .
so we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standard , especially of the British government and the other largely socialist head of EU government and include that of the United States .
we should recognise , however , that the democratic process sometimes produce uncomfortable result .
this require action to address the underlying cause , include an examination of the electoral process itself .
that should be our task , not political posturing .
Madam President , Representative of the Council , Commissioner , a week ago , the big international Holocaust Conference end in Stockholm .
it aim be to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today & apos ; s society which take the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism .
it would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite , at this time , into the institution of the EU , a xenophobic party which flirt with Nazi idea .
secondly , I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluation .
we demand of the candidate States and of the country with which the EU cooperates under the Lomé Agreement that they should respect human right and show tolerance towards their neighbour .
we must do the same a far a we ourselves be concern .
that be why we be react against this carry-on in Austria .
it be not acceptable to continue a if nothing have happen .
we be at a watershed in the history of the European Union .
the Union be not only an economic community but also a community of value , something which we take seriously.Something have happen .
the European Union be in the process of find it soul and get some steel in it spine .
Madam President , a everyone have say , this be a very important day.It be the day of the first debate of European political life .
and this be not pure chance .
I feel that today & apos ; s meeting be not a meeting of Europe , our institution , with Austria or Mr Haider & apos ; s party .
it be the meeting of Europe with itself , with it raison d & apos ; être , with the reason why we be here in this Chamber .
this Chamber be not make for good , it be not make for money .
this Chamber , and the European institution , be build to uphold value , morality and a certain spirit .
in the twentieth century , we have have experience of the fact that democracy can find themselves at risk , and morality , value and the spirit which I mention can be mortally affect by virus which have just one name : nationalist glorification , populism and the concept of racial superiority .
the fact be that it be enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider & apos ; s party , the FPÖ , to find nationalist glorification , populism and racial superiority in every chapter .
read only one sentence which my friend , Mr Vidal-Quadras , have previously mention , & quot ; The nation be define by it location , culture and race , locally , ethnically and culturally . & quot ;
well , we can not accept such statement .
( applause )
Madam President , we the Belgian Christian Democrats be concern a , fortunately , be a great many other Members too .
the coalition which be be create in one of the Member States be clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly have a European dimension too .
because what be it that unite u in Europe ? surely it be the value and principle of freedom , democracy and respect for human right , more than anything .
the Austrian Freedom Party leader , Mr Haider , have repeatedly repudiate these value .
he also repudiate the basic form of diplomatic politeness .
he be a dangerous man .
the Christian Democratic party in my country have make up their mind a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protest of extreme-right voter but never to negotiate with extreme-right leader .
value should take precedence over power .
we deplore , therefore , what be happen in Austria .
in fact , we be shake by it .
we be extremely disappointed .
a a last resort , we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternative .
we keep remind them about Article 6 of the Treaty .
we continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right .
if , despite this , the coalition go ahead , we would urge the ÖVP party member to ensure that the principle and value which underlie European integration be observe in political programme , both in word and deed .
Madam President , Austria await a heavy responsibility .
Madam President , it be clear that we in this Parliament be very largely agree on reject Mr Haider and his politics , but it be equally clear that opinion differs a to the most effective way of oppose this brand of politics .
have you stop to ask what kind of effect the debate we be have here and the statement deliver by the Council Presidency last weekend be have in Austria itself ?
have you stop to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here ?
have you stop to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP be to be fulfil and election be to be hold in Austria in the course of the next few day ?
from all account , this would only serve to strengthen Haider .
who would want this to happen ?
be it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics ?
Europe be a community of law .
democracy , respect for human right and rule of law be amongst the principle that we must uphold .
one of the precept of democracy be that we should not disapprove of electoral outcome but respect them , and that be why we must respect the fact that the Austrians , by virtue of their political culture , vote a they do .
it be for reason of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have make the statement he do , and in a manner that go against the Treaty .
( applause )
Madam President , they say , where I come from , & apos ; it & apos ; s three time for a Welshman & apos ; , and three time , a I think you will discover in the course of that debate , I signify my desire to respond very briefly to what have be an excellent , and on several occasion , a move debate .
first of all , could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleague in the Commission for the support and understanding offer by several Members of the House to the position take by the Commission in the statement that we make yesterday .
I must respond also to the fact , of course , that there be reference during the debate - and I use some of the word employ - to the ambiguity , the complacency and the fragility of the Commission & apos ; s opinion .
I be duty- bound to say to this House , there be no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offer , or indeed the action take , by the Commission on this issue .
we make explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement , a do the President this afternoon , to the fact that we share the concern demonstrate by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday .
secondly , we say , in very specific term , that we will work closely with all Member States in examine the situation a it develop in Austria .
thirdly , we express , in very explicit term , that we will uphold without fear or favour the value and the provision of Article 6 of the Treaty ; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensure that those value of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedom be upheld .
there be no complacency , no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all .
and , when I say that the Commission take that view , I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler , who be from Austria ; and who , once again , demonstrate his integrity and his independence a a Member of the European Commission , under oath , in be part of that statement that we make yesterday morning .
anyone , therefore , who invite Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality be Austrian , should examine their own motif in the context of a debate , which have be necessarily shadow by reference to xenophobia and even more lethal evil in this world .
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague , Franz Fischler .
could I also say , Madam President , that the understanding of the presidency , the Portuguese presidency , for our position , be absolutely demonstrate in the clearest term by Mr Da Costa when he say , and I quote him , that & apos ; Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine be not affect by the current situation & apos ; .
that surely be in everyone & apos ; s interest .
in order to ensure that the Treaty be upheld and that we sustain what be describe a the Community machine , we be follow the course of action which be set down in our statement yesterday .
we will continue to do that , Madam President , without fear or favour .
that be our duty .
it be also a matter of conviction .
my final point be this .
we understand the context of this essential debate .
there be several people here who like myself for many year past have become familiar with Herr Haider & apos ; s offensive statement , the xenophobia of many of his policy element and the strategy that he have develop of alternate aggressive statement with apology , sometimes on successive day .
we understand that , and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he have of Nazism .
and , when we recall that , like many others on all side of this House , my and my colleague & apos ; instinct be naturally arouse .
however , the Commission have to act on the basis of value and law and not only on the basis of instinct .
and that be why we come to the conclusion we reach yesterday morning .
that be why we sustain that conclusion a we continue to uphold the value and the law.Without fragility , without complacency , without ambiguity , but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and it people .
we will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and a Mr Cox say in the debate , & apos ; necessarily with acute vigilance & apos ; .
I wonder , since Mr Da Costa have be listen to these remark from the back of the Chamber , whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission support the view explicitly state by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the head of government .
do the Commission support the Council ?
thank you , Commissioner Kinnock .
I think that we have just have a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expect of it .
thank you , lady and gentleman .
the debate on topical and urgent subject of major importance be close .
the vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
recourse to the precautionary principle
the next item be the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle .
I want to start by say that I be pleased to be present this communication on the use of the precautionary principle , and it have be write together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen .
the precautionary principle be not a new concept .
it have be use by the Community for some time now in a range of policy area , environmental , human , animal and plant health ; and it be explicitly mention in the environmental provision of the EC Treaty since Maastricht .
it also appear in a range of international text , for example , the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol .
the essence of the precautionary principle be clear .
it involve take action in a give policy area when the science be not clear , but where there be reasonable ground for concern that the potential risk be big enough to require action .
however , the use of the precautionary principle have be increasingly in the spotlight in recent year .
event such a the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulate a grow public debate about the circumstance in which precautionary action be justified and necessary .
in view of this grow interest , the Commission therefore consider that it would be useful to present a communication to set out it position on the use of the precautionary principle .
the basic aim of the communication be twofold .
to explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies , and intend to apply , the precautionary principle in it management of risk and to set out guideline for it application base on reasoned and coherent principle .
we also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risk and to dispel fear that the precautionary principle might be use in an arbitrary way or a a disguised form of trade protectionism .
the Commission & apos ; s start point in apply the precautionary principle be the need to ensure a high level of protection in the field of environmental , human , animal and plant health .
of course , this objective can not be use to justify irrational or arbitrary measure , but it do mean that action can still be take even in situation where the science be unclear .
a such , while the precautionary principle do not involve the politicisation of science , a some have allege , it do take u to the crossroad between science and politics .
the initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depend largely on the level of protection seek and the level of risk that decision-makers be prepared to accept for society .
it be therefore political by nature .
however , the measure that may subsequently be take must obviously comply with the general principle applicable to risk management and the guideline for apply the precautionary principle be therefore the key element of the paper .
measure take must be proportional to the choose level of protection - that be , we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut .
they must be non-discriminatory in their application , that be measure should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin .
and they must be consistent with similar measure already take .
for example , if one product have be approve , similar product should also be approve .
measure be base on an examination of the potential benefit and cost of action or lack of action ; that be , the measure should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who be responsible for produce the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment , that be the burden of proof .
all these element have to apply cumulatively .
it be also important to bear in mind that there be a wide range of measure , which can be take in apply the precautionary principle.For example , a research programme , public information campaign , recommendation and so on .
this communication do not pretend to be the final word on this issue ; however , it be the first time that the Commission have present a structured presentation of the principle and it operational use .
by set out in some detail how the Commission applies , and intend to apply , the precautionary principle , we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level .
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .
I have three short question , the first be a follow .
we have be await a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it be anything but clear in the past a to whether the Commission speak with one voice .
do the document you have present here today also accord with the opinion of your colleague the Commissioners for Industry , Foreign Trade , Competition and the Internal Market ?
I be sure that your answer to this will be & quot ; yes & quot ; but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentleman be also aware a to what the consequence of this will be ?
my next question , Mrs Wallström , be when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation ; to legislation pertain to chemical or other sector , for example ?
lastly , will we be able to recognise when this principle have be apply in legislation ?
in other word , will each proposal contain an additional sheet state that check have be make a to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion have be reach ?
.Thank you very much , Dagmar Roth-Behrendt , for these question .
of course , this be share by the whole Commission .
this be a common communication which be write by the three of u , David Byrne , Erkki Liikanen and myself , but it have be pass unanimously in the Commission today .
it receive strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it have be through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission .
so we have really work through this document and I be sure that they be all able to describe the guideline and the principle a lay down in this document .
yes , I would say we already use this way of work with different , difficult issue like a new chemical strategy for example .
and , I be sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle .
we have just recently have a case of use the precautionary principle when it come to ban phthalates in soft PVC toy ; and of course , we apply it in several different environmental area .
it have be mainly use in the environmental field , but , of course also when it come to human health .
so , we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it .
Mr President , Commissioner , regard the relationship between science , on the one hand , and apply the precautionary principle on the other , the communication state that invoke that precautionary principle always require a political decision if there be a lack of scientific evidence .
needle to say , this accord science a great deal of power .
we might ask ourselves , what kind of scientist will supply this documentation and what do they stand for ?
the communication also state that the precautionary principle can be apply , provide there be a sufficient recognised minority of scientist .
I would like to ask , what be , then , the definition of a recognised minority ?
how would you describe this ?
what establish a recognised minority ?
if a political decision be involve , I would also like to ask : who take this political decision ?
the Commission ?
the Council ?
and to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this ?
what be the role of the scientific committee ?
what , also , will be the role of the food authority which you be about to set up ?
finally , will this whole decision-making process be carry out in a transparent , public way ?
these be my three question .
.Yes , Mr President , that be true .
there be many and difficult issue and not always crystal clear , but I will try to answer some question .
who will take the decision , who be the decision-makers ?
well , that depend on who the legislator be .
this be part of risk management .
they have to look at , for example , the concern of people in relation to a special issue , and they have to judge from what be know about the scientific evidence in a certain case .
however , it be true that it do not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle .
it can be use on evidence from a minority or where science be incomplete .
that be , of course , where you strike a balance between this principle a a political tool and science .
it be not always easy to describe exactly how this process be do , but there be no question of change the scientific base .
we use the expert to get a much scientific information and fact a possible before we take a decision ; and that should also be do in the future .
you have to see this a a tool for risk management .
you have to decide whether you want to put people in danger , for example , or if you want to protect the environment ; and you have to look at the science that be available .
you have to assess all that and evaluate the science .
then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not .
so , there be no answer to all your question but this do not change the system of the scientist that we use today or the system of expert that we use today .
Mr President , I have a question concern an actual , concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle .
it be about brominate flame retardant .
it be a fact that these substance be now be discovered.There be increased concentration of them in both people and the environment .
there be many people who maintain that they entail major risk , while others question how large the risk involve in these substance really be .
recently , both Sweden and Denmark urge the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominate flame retardant .
I be wonder , therefore , if you be prepare such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative .
. ( SV ) Mr President , thank you very much , Mr Sjöstedt , for this question .
the issue of brominate flame retardant be an important one .
it be raise quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of minister who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be do .
we be in the process of look into this question and assess what knowledge we have today and what it be possible to do .
allow me to remind you , however , that use of the precautionary principle do not need to be synonymous with there be a total ban .
there may be a series of different measure which can be take .
it ought not , therefore , to be immediately interpret a a ban .
where brominate flame retardant be concern , there may eventually be a ban , but it be important to say that the precautionary principle permit the whole spectrum of political measure and initiative to be take .
this issue be extremely topical .
the Commission be to do it job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what need to be do .
you say that the precautionary principle should not be use a a disguised trade barrier .
be the understanding of this point the same on both side of the Atlantic Ocean ?
I think we be go to have problem particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modify crop .
will the Americans take the same view of this point a we do ?
. ( SV ) Mr President , I be pleased to be able to tell you that , in Montreal , we have just sign a protocol concern bio-safety .
we succeed there in agree , at an international forum , a to the definition of the precautionary principle .
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeed in conclude this protocol .
I believe it will set the trend for future discussion concern the precautionary principle .
we be go to be able to use this a an example of how the precautionary principle be to be interpret .
it be , moreover , also accept a an important and effective tool .
Mr President , I have two questions.I shall try to be very brief indeed .
the first question concern the implementation of the precautionary principle .
a I have understand it , there have be a certain lack of clarity in some respect a to how this be to be understood .
be it the case that a risk assessment be firstly to be carry out , include a cost-benefit analysis ?
in that case , I be rather concern , because the idea be really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be use a a tool for decide whether the precautionary principle should be introduced.Instead , the precautionary principle should come first .
my second question concern the burden of proof .
I remember Margot Wallström be introduce a Commissioner in the Committee .
at that time , she be talk about the desire for a reversed burden of proof .
in other word , a product & apos ; s manufacturer be to demonstrate whether or not the product be hazardous .
I want to know whether this also apply in the document which the Commission have present now .
. ( SV ) Thank you , Mrs Schörling .
these be two important question , and it be good that I should be give the opportunity to clarify them .
no , one must not begin by carry out a cost-benefit analysis.Instead , the latter should be base upon an assessment of what it be we know , of what science have to tell u and of how we should view the product concern in the light of the risk we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human being or animal .
when , on the other hand , the decision have be make to take a certain measure , the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there be in fact no resort to measure which be wholly unreasonable give their degree of effectiveness .
it be not , therefore , the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis .
the second question concern the reversed burden of proof .
it be perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain case .
I have use chemical strategy a a good example of an area in which we need to do this .
there , however , we be concern with that particular area , whereas it may be say that the present communication concern the precautionary principle be horizontal in the sense that it concern the full range of specific technical area that be of political concern .
therefore , the issue of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof be to look like be not especially discuss in this context.Instead , it be a question of political decision-making and of the base for this .
it be , however , perfectly correct that , when it come , for example , to chemical , we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof .
Mr President , I believe that the precautionary principle need to be quite radical in order to work , otherwise we shall always be confuse by all the different interpretation possible .
I will give an example : a fungicide have be prove to cause baby to be bear blind.It be therefore a teratogenic substance .
very well , it be a fungicide , it kill off mould .
this teratogenicity have be demonstrate by just one English laboratory , perhaps because it be the only one that have carry out test .
now , in my opinion , give that this be such a serious risk to health , the precautionary principle lay down that this product should immediately be take off the market , which New Zealand have do , for example .
so I want to put this question to you.When human health be at stake , or there be the possibility that human health will be seriously affected , should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis ?
the cost of a baby be bear blind be too high ; there be no benefit that can compensate for this .
in short , Commissioner , I would therefore like to know whether in this case , the precautionary principle a you understand it , would in any case , require the product to be take off the market , until such time a another laboratory provide evidence to the contrary .
. ( SV ) Mr President , no one want more than I do to see a situation in which we be able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it be see a radically protect people & apos ; s health and the environment .
obviously , I can not adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which have be mention here , but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case .
the truth , of course , be that a great many Member States , and no doubt other nation too , have take measure to protect their population & apos ; health which amount to use the precautionary principle , even if it have not always be call that .
naturally , it be not in the first place a question of cost ; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure be avoid .
nor must it be a case of sit and calculate the value of a human life over and against the cost of take a particular measure .
I think , however , it be quite obvious that when it be eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be take , it be often the case that there be many different course of action to choose between .
in those circumstance , consideration should be give to what be likely to produce the best result .
I can not forbear tell you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective be use by people whom one can not perhaps imagine use it , namely when I be on a visit to Africa .
at a hospice for AIDS patient , I meet two Irish Catholic nun who be care for die AIDS patient .
they be the first to say that , each day , they must think about do what be most cost-effective because resource have to suffice for their poor patient there.We must be very careful about how we use resource .
I believe we can learn something from this .
we must , of course , always ensure that we use our resource in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help .
a be also explain in the present communication , it be not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis .
consideration should be give to what science be offer in the way of knowledge , and this should be use a an important political tool for protect the environment and people & apos ; s health .
Mr President , it be a rare honour to be give a second opportunity to ask question !
Commissioner , I would like to come back again to my first question , when I ask about the other Commissioners , for it may have sound a though I be in jest .
indeed you respond in kind , a I know you would do .
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill ask , that be to the connection we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union .
I have good reason for ask this .
a you rightly say , the precautionary principle be need in precisely those area where , a yet , there be no scientific evidence .
how can we ensure that we will not be lay ourselves open to attack at any time , for example by our partner in the USA , on account of the bio safety protocol not be adequate to their purpose ?
how can we be sure that those of your colleague responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy , will not , a they do on the last few occasion with your predecessor , keep pull the carpet from underneath you ?
that be exactly what it be all about , otherwise we might a well not bother talk about the precautionary principle here , Commissioner !
Mr President , I think it be extremely important to point to the present communication & apos ; s guideline for use the precautionary principle a a way of repudiate assertion to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reason .
I be certain that we be go to have more conflict , for example with the United States .
we should not be so naïve a to think otherwise .
ever since we sign this protocol in Montreal , we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition write into a protocol deal with the environment , health and trade .
this constitute a good example , therefore .
we should be in no doubt that conflict may arise in the future too , but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily .
we now have a number of guideline for use the precautionary principle , and we have increase support among our respective people for use it , something which be clearly establish in the present communication .
thank you , Commissioner .
the focus on the political precautionary principle mean that we have be discuss it for almost two hour and this topic be now be view , so to speak , a more than an ordinary aspect of administration , even though , a we have be able to establish from the intervention , question and reply , it be a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance .
the debate be close .
Intergovernmental Conference
the next item be the report ( A5-0018 / 2000 ) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference & # 91 ; 14094 / 1999 - C5-0341 / 1999 - 1999 / 0825 ( CNS ) & # 93 ; .
Mr President , I will begin by thank the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contact .
let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration .
the Intergovernmental Conference that be about to begin be important , both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement .
the work of the Conference will determine the structure and method base on which Europe will be function in the twentieth century .
for the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively , more democratically and with complete transparency , clearly what we need be an extensive and in-depth reform of the institution and the way they work .
the first and substantive prerequisite for achieve that reform be the agenda base on which the Intergovernmental Conference be to begin it work .
from the decision make at the Helsinki Summit , it emerge that the agenda agree there be unsatisfactory and do not guarantee the essential and substantive change require for create a more functional Europe , one that be more effective , more democratic and more transparent .
this be because the Helsinki agenda be limit to consideration only of the three issue that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union & apos ; s institutional body .
I will not repeat which one , because everyone know .
my conclusion be justify on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demand of the people of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union be already involve , namely enlargement .
grant this , the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in it agenda issue which , properly address , would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union & apos ; s institution .
just a it also must not fail to include everyday issue which , for that very reason , be highly visible to the European public .
in it numerous debate and it report so far the European Parliament have openly support the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference .
at the same time , however , I be ask for it to include issue that improve and complement the reform , I repeat , of all the institutional body a well a issue that be of direct concern and interest to the European public such a health , energy , culture , transport and even tourism .
whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widen be still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency , which have repeatedly make a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary effort towards that end .
all the same , whether or not more issue will be consider must in no way diminish the importance attribute by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference .
this be because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future be a foundation of European integration and be therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union & apos ; s Member States .
in light of what I have say , I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you , so that on 14 February , the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representative , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos , can proceed with the difficult task that await them with the European Parliament & apos ; s backing .
the same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposal he put before u .
Mr President , the Group of the European People & apos ; s Party be not satisfy with the conclusion of the European Council in Helsinki .
it seem to u that the agenda lack content , because our group be think in term of the Treaty and , specifically , the protocol on the Union & apos ; s institution .
in Helsinki , the government approve the idea that , a long a the European Union consist of fewer than 21 States , a minimal reform would be sufficient.With more than 21 , a deeper reform would become necessary .
the European Council in Helsinki itself approve enlargement involve 13 new Member States .
it be therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiation with 13 country while contemplate a minimal reform .
we be therefore think in term of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union .
have say this , Mr President , this Parliament be hold this debate today because we do not want to delay the start of the Conference .
in theory , we could have do so .
we could have vote on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have be able to start on the 14th .
however , we do not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the government and the candidate country that we want this reform to take place , precisely in order to facilitate enlargement .
Mr President , I be very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it have earn great respect in this Assembly .
the Portuguese Presidency share many of this Parliament & apos ; s aspiration and have commit itself to do everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference be widen to include other essential issue .
Mr President , I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament be not an aspiration to gain benefit for the European Parliament itself .
however , the European Parliament will be reinforce politically by the Treaty result from this Intergovernmental Conference.This be for one very simple reason : accord to the agreement make in Helsinki , this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issue , which be currently decide unanimously , be decide by a qualified majority .
therefore , the number of issue decide by a qualified majority will increase .
it be already establish within the Community acquis that those legislative issue which be decide by a qualified majority be also subject to codecision with Parliament .
therefore , since the qualified majority will be extend , there will also be more codecision with Parliament .
however , this Parliament would not be fulfil it role a a supranational European institution if it do not consider the political design of the Union .
that it be what we be do .
we believe that , in the political design of the Union , other issue need to be deal with .
these include , amongst others , the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issue , which have make much progress recently , but which must be incorporate into the Treaty .
of course there be also the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and work begin on it wording yesterday , which I believe have start very positively .
we be go to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see be European a an advantage and that European citizen have certain fundamental right which be connect to the Union & apos ; s institution .
therefore , Mr President , our proposal , which we will specify in another report , together with the proposal of the Commission , which have produce an excellent document - and I be happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - be go to be use a conference document .
we will talk about this on another day .
today we must give the green light to this conference , and , for it part , the Group of the European People & apos ; s Party , Mr President , be ready to give that green light .
Mr President , for the Socialist Group I can say we will be support the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteur on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee .
we be give a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have be impress by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which have take on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widen .
the Amsterdam leftover be not a very good term , because they be very important subject in themselves .
let u call them the first three subject of the IGC .
these first three subject be very important but they be subject which be explore in detail by our Member States during the last IGC .
they do not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine month of further study .
they need a political deal .
it be more a question of nine minute , perhaps nine hour if it be difficult , lock away together in a room to reach a solution on these subject , not nine month .
in those circumstance it would be silly not to widen the agenda .
there be other issue that should fruitfully be look at , especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new country .
nobody be ask for a Christmas tree .
nobody be ask for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subject be debate .
however , there be six , seven , eight , nine perhaps , subject which it would be very appropriate and useful to address .
there be time .
remember the IGC that lead to the Single European Act .
it last only five month .
the IGC that lead to the enormous Maastricht Treaty last a year .
only the Amsterdam Treaty last a year and a half and that be because everyone knew you have to wait for the result of the British election if you be go to have any outcome from that IGC so that be a different reason .
a year be ample time to address a large number of issue and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial point that we wish to be add to the agenda .
I be pleased to see that the Commission share our view .
the Commission have just publish it opinion and it have do exactly what Parliament ask of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty article .
I thank the Commission for do that even if , of course , I do not agree with everything the Commission say .
I think there be some gap in what they have put forward .
nonetheless the Commission have provide a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who be here with u today for do that .
they have lay out for the public to see some of the crucial issue that we be go to have to address in this IGC .
that be all to the good .
the Parliament , the Council presidency and the Commission be pull in the same direction for a wider agenda .
we should no longer be worry that the agenda for the IGC will be restrict .
that be one of the political conclusion that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relation with a partner .
it make it impossible for those same Member States , at the IGC , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental right .
it be already strange within the convention that be draft the charter to see representative of some Member States , especially Britain and France , seek to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty .
it be vital that the IGC prepare the way to accept the installation of a fundamental right regime within the Treaty .
one part of this be to improve the access of the citizen to the Court .
another be for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention .
another be clearly for national parliament and national political party to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affair and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy .
my group strongly welcome the IGC and will be contribute to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent .
Mr President , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance believe that the European Parliament & apos ; s decision to rush headlong into give it opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermine the political significance of the request for talk with the Council , and in the end , make it rather irrelevant .
we would have prefer to have have greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantee on the method before give our opinion , and frankly , we do not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency show towards the European Parliament by schedule the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine & apos ; s day , the first day of the Strasbourg part-session .
moreover , give that this opinion be quite important , we can still vote for it , and indeed , the majority of our group will be vote for it .
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it be quite distress to see the lack of real interest in this reform .
the event in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principle which provide base all the Member States .
it be also distress to think that the initiative take against Austria be actually the result of an agreement between government and that , in any case , the European Union and it institution would not have have the mean or the consensus to allow them to act , and to prevent and rectify the course of event .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , to my mind , it can not be say often or loud enough that what the Council have adopt in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference be completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful .
after all , we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance , that be to say , we be negotiate or be on the point of take up negotiation with 12 States , and together we have reach a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future .
how , though , be the Union to be enlarge if we do not do the job properly now , i.e . before enlargement take place ?
that be why we a a group be in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference .
we consider it to be indispensable and urgently need and hope that it actually come up with the good that will enable u to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future .
my group , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , note with satisfaction that the Council Presidency be far from happy with the current state of affair .
you can therefore rest assure that the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left be commit to see that the Union get on with the task in hand .
what we be talk about be nothing more and nothing le than the future of Europe , and , in particular , a Europe that the citizen truly regard a be theirs , because they be instrumental in shape it and because the care and concern , the problem and issue they face on a daily basis be also take seriously by politician .
the politics of closed door and private discussion ; all that must be consign to the past once and for all .
that be why we need transparency .
I believe it fall to you , a President-in-Office of the Council , to see to it that the train do not keep roll on a before , leave the people behind on the platform a if they be ignorant a to the content of the treaty .
we believe it be imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizen with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference be go , and it outcome , rather they must be directly involve in the overall reform process to a far greater extent .
we also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizen in referendum , once the Intergovernmental Conference be over , whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe be to continue to develop in the future .
in this way , Europe would truly belong to the citizen and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy .
there be another central issue relate to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to .
a a member of the convention that have now take up it work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights , I wish to make the following point clear : neither my group nor I be content with make a solemn announcement about the Charter .
after all , what will the citizen say if we make a solemn announcement about right to them but they be unable to take legal action in respect of these right a individual ?
no , to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis face the Union .
the poor turnout at the European election really should have be warn enough for everyone .
what we need be visible right for each and every citizen ; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be make legally bind for all the citizen of the Union .
together we should work towards this goal in the interest of the citizen , and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference be that the relevant Cologne decision will be revise here at the end of the year .
of course , we be also talk about effectiveness of decision and function institution in a Union of 27 plus Member States .
we will not achieve this just by undertake a mini reform , a the Council have resolve to do , and that be why all institution must come under scrutiny .
we need bold change and , at the same time , we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal right for the major and small States .
this be something I would stress , particularly with my be an MEP for one of the major Member States .
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposal they have put forward and I be certain that comprehensive discussion with the citizen will ensue here in the European Parliament , on all the issue you have raise .
there be one final issue I would like to raise .
Parliament & apos ; s opinion expressly demand amendment to the Treaty in the area of economic policy .
it be indeed the case that globalisation of national economy , but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have lead to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making process .
what we need most of all be to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union & apos ; s policy to date .
it be all about create a socially just Europe .
a socially just Europe be still highly topical , for what we need to do a a matter of priority be place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union & apos ; s policy .
Mr President , the Union for a Europe of Nations Group consider that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , a set by the Helsinki Council , i.e . focus strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe , must be adhere to .
it must be adhere to in the interest of the fast , effective work of the conference , prior to enlargement .
this be why we can not subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission , which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and , what be more , widen it in the wrong direction , i.e . move towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system .
our group have therefore table a raft of amendment which , when take together , form a real alternative resolution .
in them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pay greater attention to national sovereignty .
we deplore the fact that the Commission , in it opinion of 26 January , limit itself to follow the routine path of a standardise Europe enlarge towards the East , a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decision .
the federalist imagine that they be thereby go to create unity through constraint , but this be a totally superficial concept .
quite the opposite , in an enlarged Europe , Mr President , the standardisation impose by the improper use of majority decision can lead only to the whole thing exploding .
furthermore , the centralise European system , a we can see it develop today and a we can foresee it by extrapolation , erodes nation and , in erode nation , erode the national patriotism which form the basis of our will to defend ourselves .
the Europe which result from this be not stronger but weaker , a it no longer know what it be or what it be defend .
this be why we have always say that enlargement be possible only if the diversity and freedom of the people of Europe be clearly recognise , i.e . by adopt flexibility found upon the respect of national sovereignty .
we be delight today to see the progress this idea have enjoy in certain circle , one which be still , unfortunately , outside the European Parliament and the Commission .
a flexible Europe , be a Europe which respect it national democracy , which rely on the support of it nation , it national patriotism , instead of continually persecute them .
it be this that give u the determination to defend ourselves against external threat , not the constraining , convolute decision making procedure which the Commission think it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference .
Mr President , I be speak on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he have see what Parliament & apos ; s opinion be .
this be the message that Parliament be send to the Council .
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliment to those already offer - can convey Parliament & apos ; s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine & apos ; s day.In any case , tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda .
this message must be very clear ; this be how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow .
we shall give an opinion - which be technically and legally necessary - on convene the IGC on 14 February , but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of it content .
there be clearly a more ambitious goal .
we Radicals have table amendment which we be submit to the House in order to consolidate this text , and for example , to request - just for the sake of mention Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be do , i.e . , that the European Parliament should also be involve in draw up the European Constitution and that a proposal be make for the European Parliament to adopt the amendment to the Treaty .
we know that there be other topic : for example , many Members have subscribe , along with u , to the issue of the seat of the institution , an issue that we believe should be consider at least at IGC level .
in conclusion , I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once , so that thanks also to the effort of the Portuguese Presidency , this agenda will be revise .
otherwise , the challenge really would be lose , not just for the present but also for many year to come .
Mr President , the President of the Commission be not be quite honest when he talk last week about the Intergovernmental Conference .
and , in this regard , you be go to the heart of democracy a it relate to distribution policy and people & apos ; s social condition , which be what voter wish to influence when they go to the poll .
these be matter which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon a voter and no longer be able to change on election day .
Brussels know best .
Mr Prodi also announce greater transparency , but his draft regulation signal a clear backward step , and that be not only my assessment , but also that of the European Ombudsman .
today , the Commission be oblige , on a case-by-case basis , to weigh consideration of confidentiality against people & apos ; s demand for , and expectation of , transparency and , if the Commission & apos ; s regulation be adopt , the Commission will be entitle to lock away whole category of document without have to give them specific consideration .
there be also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away document of a kind which be at present publicly available in a range of Member States .
under the banner of & quot ; progress towards transparency & quot ; , a range of document be be lock away from the general public .
it be , of course , thoroughly Orwellian .
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which be not , at the same time , available for critical scrutiny by the public .
Mr Prodi secure positive comment for a proposal which would otherwise have be meet with criticism , for the new draft regulation present a progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to document in the Commission & apos ; s possession.There follow , however , a long , long list of exception , and there be legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exception .
the French text contain the word & quot ; refuse & quot ; and the English text the word & quot ; shall & quot ; , which mean that the Commission be to keep secret such information a be today available to the public , for example in my own country .
in addition , we have a flexible clause concern the efficiency of the negotiation and of the institution , which may be use for any purpose whatsoever.It be therefore ...
( the President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , lady and gentleman , the Portuguese Council Presidency & apos ; s account have give me the distinct impression that we be approach this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered idea and a high degree of openness .
we a a European Parliament will use these opportunity to see that our issue be give the attention they deserve .
the preparation the Commission have make so far be on the right track , although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament & apos ; s motion be anything to go by .
there be more to be say on that score .
it be crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick ; that of the power to act , democratic legitimacy and transparency .
in the end , it be only by have these three thing in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizen .
at the same time of course , we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union .
if we have be have a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only go to show how important this be .
the European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government elect to impose a total blockade .
this be an important sign that majority voting be a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union & apos ; s be able to function come what may .
this be particularly important where enlargement be concern , and legislation and in relation to treaty , which entail change be make to legislation .
of course we also want to extend the European Parliament & apos ; s correspond power in this area .
in addition , we a a European Parliament be go to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union , for there be a lack of supervision in this area .
the Finance Ministers behave a if they be in an intergovernmental meeting , when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council , which be an unacceptable way to go on .
unlike Mrs Kaufmann , I be not in favour of extend supervision over the European Central Bank a I be an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank .
however , there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side .
furthermore , the tripartite relationship of Commission , Council and Parliament must be restore to the sphere of foreign and security policy , where hitherto the Council be in sole charge far more than should have be the case , especially in relation to the crudely fashion crisis management measure , for which the Commission alone have responsibility .
the overall plan fail to do justice to any of this .
we must examine whether any change be need to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference .
the Portuguese Presidency have agree to initiate deliberation on this matter , perhaps to extend the mandate .
there be another point I would just like to draw your attention to .
the debate we be have these day , on a certain European country & apos ; s government , for example , show , do they not , that we must place the spiritual , moral , constitutional , community and common welfare-orientated leaning of the European Union on a firm footing , and that legally bind fundamental right must also be incorporate into the Treaty for the same reason , a this will be a crucial stabilising factor .
I would urge those who be still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now be not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matter of fundamental right .
the European Union need few , if any , new instrument , and it do not need any new competence .
what it do need be instrument that will enable it to put it competence into practice .
for this reason , we must ensure that the instrument have the effect of enable u to carry out , on behalf of the citizen , the task we have already formally be set in the Treaty .
in my view , that be the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference have to concentrate it energy on .
if we succeed in make progress here , then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarge the European Union .
this be the crux of the matter .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I be confident that this will be tackle in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage .
, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs . ( it ) Mr President-in-Office , on listen to the various intervention , you have understand that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leader of Parliament & apos ; s political group , the decision prevail - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency , instead of create more difficulty by postpone the start of the Intergovernmental Conference .
I can assure you that it be not easy to achieve this , last week in the Committee I chair , but we eventually decide to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager .
you speak to u about the start of your tour around the various capital city and tell u about the difficulty that some government have in reach a consensus in their own country , and therefore in their parliament .
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we have a very worthwhile day of discussion and dialogue with the representative of the 15 national parliament , which be represent by competent and exact delegation .
the aim be not to draw conclusion - it be impossible to draw any - but the debate be certainly very encouraging .
we need to be careful and be sure that national government try to convince their respective parliament to ratify solution that correspond to the Union & apos ; s requirement for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliament to avoid sign appropriate conclusion at the Intergovernmental Conference table .
however , we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliament for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference .
yesterday , we also discuss the Commission , represent by Commissioner Barnier , who give it opinion .
this effort be appreciate , even if different view be later express a regard the proposal , and moreover , Mr President-in-Office , you also express different view .
nevertheless , we must stress that many people be aware , a they be yesterday too , of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe , a risk that be , moreover , indicate in an interview that surely escape no one & apos ; s attention , owe to the authority of the person be interview - Jacques Delors .
we be count on the Portuguese Presidency , we be count on ourselves and we be count on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debate on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference .
Mr President , only a strengthen Europe can cope with enlargement .
only a strengthen Europe be immune to political opportunist who exploit dissatisfaction .
that be why sweeping reform be necessary and , hence , a widened IGC agenda .
the Finnish Presidency only listen to minimalist government and , unfortunately , turn a deaf ear to this Parliament .
Portugal should not take a leaf out it predecessor & apos ; s book .
it be of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join force for this IGC .
in many way , they share the same interest and the same insight .
an essential component of this joint effort should , in any case , be this Parliament & apos ; s right of assent to the forthcoming change to the Treaty .
of all priority , this one be the most pressing .
what be the Commission & apos ; s verdict on this ?
it also mean that our Parliament President and the two representative should be able to take part on an equal political footing and , therefore , not only within the work party , but also at the same political level a the Commission .
there be no reason whatsoever why representative directly elect by citizen should be involve in talk at a lower level than the Commission .
not only do we owe the sweeping reform to the new Member States , but we owe them to ourselves .
if we allow Europe to be water down a a result of enlargement , we will drown in our own political quagmire .
Mr President , there be day when I really can not understand this Parliament.It seem to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation .
after have restrict , on it own initiative , it participation in the IGC to two minor seat , Parliament be now give up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC .
the fact be , whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way , you will admit - in rush to give it opinion , Parliament be give up the only lever which the Treaty accord it , i.e . demand a complete IGC agenda a a prerequisite before declare it opinion .
why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow , 3 February , a a matter of urgency , when we could wait , in a position of strength , until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February , and thus force an agenda that be complete , and therefore consistent , on the Council .
a good dose of hypocrisy be need to overlook our weakness today .
hypocrisy to be regret bitterly , in our resolution , that the agenda for the IGC be not equal to the issue , since in our haste , with blameworthy naivety , we be stop ourselves force through this more ambitious agenda .
if there be a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC , then I say that the political group which so want this haste will be accountable for this .
whether we want it or not , since Parliament itself be go to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shed a little light on the debate , the venue for decision be now go to move to the 15 Member States of the Union .
I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority , those who last November rule that the future of Europe be deserve of debate that go far wider than the Amsterdam leftover , to take up their pilgrim & apos ; staff and go and convince their own government that this IGC must be extend , since this be permit accord to the resolution of the Helsinki Council .
because of the situation in Austria , this be a dark day for Europe .
it make u realise that the victory of democracy be never definitive , and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing .
in order to assert our fundamental value , they need to be lay down in writing , a a matter of urgency , and , beyond this IGC , I believe we owe Europe a constitution .
Mr President , the draft resolution we be now discuss require , precisely a before , that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involve radical reform of the institution .
the forthcoming enlargement of the Union be use a an argument for this .
I be convince that this be an error of judgement .
a federal and centralist EU which intervene more and more in the government of the Member States be in actual fact le well place for enlargement .
a flexible EU which concentrate on fewer but important area and which respect national difference and national democracy have a better chance of embrace a significantly greater number of country .
paragraph D of the draft resolution require a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level .
it be not , however , possible to talk about this without at the same time talk about monetary union .
this text say nothing about the major democratic and political problem involve monetary union and the European Central Bank.This be untenable .
if there be a desire to make the EU more democratic , the whole construction of EMU must be reconsider .
the Central Bank must be place under political control so that the direction to be take by monetary policy may be govern by political objective such a high employment and prosperity.Public control of the Central Bank must be improve if this be to become possible .
the rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discard so that we might have a uniform policy which have prosperity a it primary objective .
Article 56 of the Treaty , prohibit currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital , must be remove so that damage currency speculation may be check by mean of political control .
in the majority of EU country , there be now government dominate by social democrat .
it be remarkable that , now they have the opportunity to do so , none of them be demand any change in the direction take by monetary union .
it also , of course , damage credibility when it be state that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalise capital .
the resolution require the European Parliament to have increase influence over the Intergovernmental Conference .
it be , however , important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference be and will remain a conference of the Member States .
it be the Member States & apos ; parliament , or people vote in referendum , who be to direct the development of the Treaty .
it be therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be give any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification .
Mr President , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs have propose an essentially positive text , which I shall vote for , even if I personally have propose a lot of amendment to broaden it .
nevertheless , the event of the last few day show that all those who have make basic criticism of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have be plan be right .
the Union can not be enlarge to 28 without address the matter of whether Europe have certain joint principle and value , whether it come down to an economic free trade area , or whether , on the other hand , it have a greater ambition : the desire to be a supranational union , in way that have yet to be define , that want to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world .
this be what be and be mean by the call for a European Constitution .
the amendment of the Treaties be , however , limit to a review of some internal rule , which be necessary and important , but do not answer the fundamental question : what be Europe , what be it common principle and therefore , it objective and limitation ?
however , politics exact it revenge , and have be throw out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda , it come back in , a a matter of fact , through a door , and through the front door in the case of Austria , since a party be enter the Austrian Government which seem to represent a return to intolerance , xenophobia and form of racism .
and it be not a question of link with the past ; it be a question of prospect for the future , and nothing could be more wrong than the right and leave take a divided stand on this .
I belong to a world , the world of Liberal Catholics , which be not left-wing but which hold a dear a anyone else the value of tolerance and common European value , and will have nothing to do with policy that reject these value .
the Council have do well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these value in a Charter of Fundamental Rights , in a European Constitution , then we shall construct a Europe without a solid , lasting base .
Commissioner Barnier , I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representative of the Portuguese Presidency share these value : make the most of the chance you be give by the December Conference to include these subject and principle , because this be the only way we will build a lasting Europe .
Mr President , I be in the happy position of be able to refer to a couple of strike contribution from a small group of Nordic sceptic and opponent of the drastic and grow integration process which , look long and hard at , threaten the whole of democratic Europe .
I be think of the contribution from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contain a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiative dictate by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU .
they rightly include the problem with monetary union and centralist government and present a number of alternative democratic principle .
however , that be precisely what be happen .
with every single geographical extension to the area cover by the EU , we have see how extension in breadth have be follow by intensive extension in depth , and that be precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee be contemplate , especially in paragraph 7 which say that there should be more thorough integration in depth .
in the light of development in recent day , it might well be ask what we really be to do about these intergovernmental conference and treaty amendment when government leader - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decision in relation to an independent Member State entail intervention in that Member State & apos ; s democratic process .
you can think what you like about Mr Haider , and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician , but you can not just intervene in an independent and friendly country & apos ; s democratic process .
when we hold intergovernmental conference and consider change to the Treaty , we must take into account the fact that the EU be develop all the time , sometimes in contravention of the Treaty , a we have just see .
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon .
on 14 February , we will see the launch of the IGC which be to be complete by the end of 2000 .
this be a big task but it can be do .
I think it be generally agree here this afternoon across all group that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement .
in other word we need to go further than what have be refer to a the important & quot ; Amsterdam leftover & quot ; .
these include the extension of qualified vote - in my country we accept that but not to area of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger state and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe .
in relation to the latter point , Ireland want to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining .
we be prepared to consider re-weighting the vote in the Council of Ministers , provide that the larger Member States be willing to agree to every Member State have a full and equal Member of the Commission .
I feel I speak for many smaller country when I make that particular point .
at the IGC , we would also need a debate on the possible division of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution .
we would accept the division of the Treaties provide it would not limit the control the smaller Member States have in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty .
in other word , if we be not represent fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussion .
so we be watch that entire point extremely carefully .
we look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to see it content .
the Treaty of Amsterdam , Mr President , have set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate be need in this Parliament on how that number will be distribute among the enlarge Europe .
Mr President , I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos / Leinen resolution , which clearly express both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place a soon a possible .
in any case , this emerge from the favourable schedule we decide upon .
I think that , under the present rule of the Treaties , the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation .
on the contrary , we should concentrate on work out persuasive proposal on the necessary reform , in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposal be worthy of note .
we must use dialogue at every political level , include of course dialogue with the national parliament .
that way , we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reform .
Parliament & apos ; s representative at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiate that , with the Union & apos ; s institutional change , we be face with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union .
they must therefore realise that such issue can not be decide on the rationale of bargain alone .
the issue to be deal with at this Intergovernmental Conference be exceptionally sensitive .
it may be easy to come up with solution , but what matter be how well those solution will stand up in the long term .
I will mention two point that may create tension .
one be the balance which have so far be maintain between large and small country .
Europe be not , nor can it become a classic federal state .
the solution we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union , which be a union of state and people .
the other area of conflict be more difficult .
owe to the imminent increase in membership , the body of the future European Union must become more effective .
this mean that they must function more simply and more rapidly .
by it very nature , however , the European Union be , and will remain , a complex and convolute multi-governmental institution .
possibility for faster and more simple operation do exist .
of course they do , but they be not unlimited .
if the limit be exceed because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness , then the legitimise basis of the European Union will suffer .
I be , however , optimistic .
Mr President , the Intergovernmental Conference mandate need to be widen .
the most important issue with regard to this be internal differentiation within the Union .
it be unfortunate that there have be no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union , which will , however , be necessary if the Union be to enlarge a plan .
the Commission & apos ; s former president , Jacques Delors , have once again publicly raise the issue of a European Confederation .
he have also say that the country in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institution , for the sake of clarity .
the Commission & apos ; s current President , Mr Prodi , and the High Representative , Mr Solana , have put forward idea along the same line .
last November , the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopt a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it propose a system of concentric ring for Europe : the onion skin model .
in the next resolution on the IGC , Parliament must take a long and hard look at the question of differentiation and flexibility .
both enlargement and the achievement of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric ring , a propose by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party .
my colleague , Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already speak , somewhat sceptically , about some aspect of the matter in hand .
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity , not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing region .
this have be give inadequate attention and there be many thing to be concern about .
may I particularly draw attention to one of the implication of enlargement in respect of this Parliament .
a ceiling of 700 have be prescribe a the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly .
if you apply the exist principle of digressive proportionality , six seat for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitant , you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people have more Members in this Chamber than Wales , which be a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom .
Scotland , with a population of 5 million , have eight seat in this House at the moment ; Denmark and Finland , with the same population , have sixteen .
now what be go to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700 , bring in 26 % more population over time , and then adopt the Commission & apos ; s , I think ill-considered , proposition , that there should be a European list of candidate .
what will happen to a place like Scotland , which I represent here ?
it will become totally invisible !
Members of this House should not in these circumstance be in the least surprised that in these discussion , people in Scotland and other such country be ask whether enlargement should not also take the form of admit new Member States from within exist one .
a grow body of opinion in Scotland hold that view .
Mr President , to say that the European Union be at a crossroad be no doubt nothing new.It have be say many time .
this time , however , it be true .
we have establish the single currency - which be extremely positive - and we be face enlargement .
the question be if we will undertake enlargement whether we be prepared or not .
will we enlarge with or without deep reform ?
that be the debate , and this question must be address in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference , it agenda or it method .
it be clear that the Council , for the moment , have not opt for enlarge with deep reform in place .
that put enlargement in danger.It jeopardises any prospect of political union and , of course , it be difficult for the public to understand .
the Council must realise that , if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement build on firm foundation , the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further .
the Council be consult u and Parliament be give it opinion .
we want an Intergovernmental Conference , but not this one .
must there be an IGC ?
of course there must , but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference .
the agenda must go much further.We must be much more daring with regard to the issue deal with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic .
be much more democratic mean greater participation by the European Parliament and allow the Commission to exercise even more - yes , more - it ability to take the initiative .
we must clearly set firm objective .
the functionalist approach be over , for better or for worse .
the functionalist approach have bring u to this point .
have we achieve result ?
yes , but the point be to make a qualitative leap and , speak in political term , this , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , mean convince the other Community partner that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment .
Mr President , lady and gentleman of the House , at this stage , follow this debate which I have listen to most attentively and with great interest , I should like to make a few comment in addition to the guideline and the statement which it have be my honour to present to you in the course of recent week in the company of President Prodi .
a far a we be concern , after produce the opinion expect from the Commission , accord to this same Article 48 of the Treaty , we be pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipate .
we know , I know myself , that the week we have before u will be useful to u .
I would just like to make a few comment , after read the draft opinion and after listen to the speaker on behalf of the various group .
firstly , lady and gentleman , the Commission understand the anxiety express by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda .
I understand this anxiety , this fear that the agenda may be too limited , and yet I feel , a I say to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on return from Helsinki , that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate .
indeed , it be in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate , which the Commission frame for it own opinion , but use all the term thereof , plus everything between the line .
we have not restrict ourselves to the three so-called leftover , which be , in any case , an incorrect label .
I do not like the term & apos ; leftover & apos ; any more than Richard Corbett do .
it give the impression that they be three minor or insignificant subject whereas in fact they be three extremely serious and important subject , and difficult , so difficult that we do not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth .
a far a we be concerned - I be respond to Mr Seguro who express concern about this just now - we have not restrict ourselves to these three subject , even though I do consider them a priority , and consider that they must be deal with now .
they be the first but they be not the only subject , Mr Seguro , that the conference must deal with .
we have deal with other subject and we have mention our idea that other subject may be deal with in this conference , if the Portuguese Presidency firstly , and then the French Presidency , so wish , in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement .
we be ready for it , whether it be a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , on which work have start , the CFSP and the consequence for the institution of the current defence policy negotiation , or an extremely difficult subject on which we be continue to work : reorganisation of the Treaties .
I have hear many comment on the Commission & apos ; s opinion , which mention all these subject and dealt with many of them in depth , with specific indication of new draft article , but no one have say that we be go beyond the Helsinki mandate .
this prove that it be possible to go into issue in depth while respect this mandate , by use the term lay down in the mandate and all the opening which it offer .
a regard the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceeding , I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me , on the basis of our shared experience , in say that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiate group in which your two representative , Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok , be go to be work .
of course , the final trade-off will be make , a in any institutional negotiation , and I think this be no bad thing , at Council level , especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government , who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hand .
let me point out , in passing , that the Commission President , Mr Prodi , be also a Council member , and he have every intention of make use of this position and this role , alongside the Heads of State and Government , particularly during the final period .
however , these Council proceeding must be carefully prepared .
this preparatory work , this fine-tuning , must not be omit , lady and gentleman of the House.I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it be extremely important and useful , and that it will not just be limit to technical detail .
I think that all of u , the personal representative of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs , your two representative , and myself , a a representative of the Commission , will be go into matter in detail , but it will be afterwards , at a different level , one in which we will also be participate , that the last trade-off must be make .
throughout this conference , lady and gentleman , it be not only the status of the negotiator which be important , but the quality of what they will be say .
and once again I should like to point out in this House , in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam , that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledge to the two representative of the European Parliament , prior to Amsterdam , the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok say count for a lot in these negotiation .
I be sure that the situation will be just the same and , a far a I be concerned , in my current position , I shall ensure that the contribution of your two representative be listen to and respect throughout these negotiation .
I be sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiation any more than the Commission will be .
we now await , therefore , with great interest , lady and gentleman of the House , your next opinion , in which you will specify Parliament & apos ; s priority and practical proposal for these negotiation .
in the coming month , lady and gentleman of the House , the Commission will therefore be work in close cooperation , on good term , with your two representative , Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok , in order to reconcile our point of view , if need be .
quite probably , our point of view and our position will not always be the same.There will probably be difference of opinion , that would be only normal .
the important thing be that we be consistent , and I have be commit to work towards this consistency ever since I accept the position of Commissioner .
our concern and our ambition , therefore , on a large number of subject , be to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiation forward successfully .
this will not be a matter of chance , since , let me repeat , I feel we have the same ambition for these negotiation and that together we see it a a moment of truth for the European Union .
finally , I should like to make three additional comment , quite briefly , Mr President .
firstly , to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano , the chairman , and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it take yesterday in bring together the competent representative of national parliament , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate .
such dialogue between the national parliament , the European Parliament and ourselves be extremely important .
I have say , furthermore , that I would play my part by visit each of the national parliament .
tomorrow , I shall be in London .
in a fortnight & apos ; s time , I shall be in Berlin .
in three week & apos ; time , I shall be in Paris , and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another .
I feel this initiative you have take be extremely positive , and I should like to thank you for take it .
my second brief comment be to thank the Portuguese Presidency , particularly Mr Seixas da Costa , for his proactive approach .
indeed , the comment which have just be make express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own : the Portuguese Presidency can not be just an interim presidency .
it will have to initiate these negotiation .
we be well aware that they can not be complete within these six month and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency , in the hope that a conclusion can be reach before the end of the year 2000 .
not only that a conclusion can be reach , but that a successful conclusion can be reach , which be not necessarily the same thing .
conclude negotiation be not the same a conclude them successfully .
the handover will have be make , but the condition in which the handover be go to be make , by yourself , Mr President , and by the Portuguese Presidency , be go to be extremely important , a be the nature of this handover .
it be all the work which be go to be carry out together , under your guidance particularly , in the course of these few month , which be extremely important .
we have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency & apos ; s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion , and indeed great expectation thereof.Portugal be a small country , but be a small country be no reason why one may not have great ambition .
after have hear Prime Minister Guterres , the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself , I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiation .
it can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few month .
finally , let me repeat , we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topic of these negotiation .
these be difficult subject , subject relate to institutional policy and mechanism which be not always easy to explain .
all the more reason for Members of the European Parliament , Ministers , Commissioners to devote a little time to explain matter to the citizen , to public debate .
a far a the Commission be concern , it will , lady and gentleman , be take initiative to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate .
cross-border service
the next item be the joint debate on the following report :
A5-0007 / 2000 by Mrs Berger , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of worker who be third-country national for the provision of cross-border service ( COM ( 1999 ) 3 - C4-0095 / 1999 - 1999 / 0012 ( COD ) ) ;
A5-0012 / 2000 by Mrs Berger , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on a proposal for a Council directive extend the freedom to provide cross-border service to third-country national establish in the Community ( COM ( 1999 ) 3 - C4-0096 / 1999 - 1999 / 0013 ( CNS ) ) .
- ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to apologise for be a little hoarse today , but we Austrian MEPs have have a lot of explain and talk to do .
I would first like to say how indebted I be to the Commission for seize the initiative , and for the two draft directive we be discuss here today .
it have thereby succeed in close two serious loophole in the internal market which be of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country national in the European Union who be here a worker or on a self-employed basis .
the current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - be that there be in fact judgement from the European Court of Justice relate to employee , I refer in particular to those relate to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst .
these have , in fact , clarify that the freedom to provide service must allow for third-country national to be take on a employee of cross-border service and this without have to obtain work permit .
however , the European Court of Justice do not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirement and condition of residence and consequently the Member States be unable to clarify this issue .
furthermore , not all Member States have abide by the Court of Justice & apos ; s verdict with regard to the lapsing of the work permit requirement , and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barrier in place in respect of cross-border service ; barrier that be often impossible to overcome , especially for the smaller company .
the situation a far a self-employed people be concern be that current Community invest legal right do not afford third-country national the right to provide cross-border service .
there be no doubt that we need a legislative act here .
both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide service for EU enterprise .
it be not about establish original right for third-country national model on freedom of movement .
all provision , i.e . issue relate to entry into the EU and to the law pertain to residence right , should be regard a ancillary to this freedom to provide service .
I , together with the European Parliament & apos ; s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , be therefore of the opinion that the Commission have choose the right legal base and that the opposite view , a express in the report produce by the Council & apos ; s Legal Service , be inappropriate .
consequently , I do not see that there be any real obstacle to the Council & apos ; s be able to move matter on quickly a far a these two draft directive be concern .
I also believe that Parliament & apos ; s propose amendment should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directive a oppose to the Commission & apos ; s proposal .
many of our amendment relate back to concern that be also voice in the Council , and we be attempt to reconcile these concern with the task that fall to u by dint of extant law and economic good sense .
when it come to acceptance by the Council , I can only urge the Commission to adopt a many of the amendment adopt by Parliament a possible , even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposal .
I be absolutely convinced that it will be easier for u to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis .
turn now to the most important of our propose amendment , one of the essential difference be that , in place of a & quot ; service provision card plus notification for each individual contract & quot ; system , provision be no longer make for be able to request the previous notification from the receive state for each individual contract .
this system appear to u to be unsuitable in practical term .
however , in order to compensate for this , all possible obstacle must be remove before the service provision card be issue , and a the Commission & apos ; s proposal would have it , more stringent condition must be satisfy before a service provision card be issue .
an individual be require to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection , not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout it period of validity and for three month thereafter .
this should serve a a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the send state once the contract be complete and that they will be cover under insurance law in the event of illness or accident .
likewise , the situation with regard to right of entry and residence right should be clarify before the service provision card be issue , namely under the term of an opposition procedure .
what we be propose be that it should not just be a case of have to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States , rather one should also have the option of apply for it for individual Member States .
I believe this system be also more suited to practical need .
I would hope that the same hold true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three month , and to be flexible in adapt the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting .
however , we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 month .
when it come to self-employed person , in addition to the amendment already describe , we propose that the domicile criterion should be make more stringent , and that we should make provision for the possibility of counter any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment .
I would also just like to go into those of the propose amendment that go beyond the proposed amendment put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
of course I would add that I continue to support this committee & apos ; s amendment , which they adopt unanimously .
I have even submit four amendment on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quote Council decision .
I must say I have receive extremely contradictory statement from Parliament & apos ; s service a to exactly how these Council decision should be quote ; whether or not one should use the number or date alone , or both , and how extensively to quote from them .
two amendment be cancel by the service because the content have supposedly already be give consideration to in the report .
I withdraw the two other amendment - that be Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed person and Amendment No 21 on employed person .
I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement a quickly a possible on the correct way to proceed in matter of comitology , i.e . the correct way to quote .
this would make our rapporteur & apos ; s life considerably easier in the future .
there be also a propose amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio & apos ; s report .
unfortunately I have to say that I be unable to support this propose amendment because it in fact change the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolve on unanimously , and I would like to stand by this outcome , which we arrive at together after lengthy discussion .
on a final note , I would like to thank all those in the Committee who support me in compile these report , which be far from easy to produce .
I would like to single Mr Wieland out for special mention , for he have the dubious honour of be the shadow rapporteur and be involve to a far greater extent than be customary in the draw up of this report , contribute excellent and constructive idea ; and this without be in a position to receive the plaudit award a rapporteur .
that be why he deserve special mention !
( NL ) Mr President , I be pleased I have be give the opportunity to make a few introductory remark at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger & apos ; s speech , after which I will , of course , listen with all due attention to the next speakers.If you allow me , Mr President , I would like to go into the different amendment in more detail at the end of the debate .
may I say how the Commission welcome the European Parliament & apos ; s support for the two proposal on the freedom to provide service and on third-country employee , the topic of the debate .
I be extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger have put into these proposal which be politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge .
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution a chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
the Commission particularly welcome the suggestion make by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision card .
if the opportunity be create to apply for service provision card for one or more , or all , Member States , the procedure would be more flexible still .
the Commission also support the propose flexible period of validity of the card .
however , I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee be resident in a Member State .
the Commission also agree with a provision for case in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer be terminate at short notice .
an efficient procedure for issue card implies that company which provide cross-border service can also exercise their right in concrete term on the basis of the internal market .
it seem over the top to u for other Member States to be give the option of systematically carry out inspection systematically with a view to safeguard public order before they issue card .
indeed , it should be possible for a third-country subject who have legal status in a Member State to be admit to other Member States too .
that do not prevent these Member States from take public-order measure within the framework of the propose duty of notification .
neither do the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three month after the card have expire .
follow completion of the service , it be not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service be provide .
that be why the Commission support Mrs Palacio & apos ; s Amendment No 22 in both respect .
a far a the second proposal be concern , the Commission appreciate the wish that it should be clear what be mean by someone who be self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amend proposal .
these be a few introductory remark concern the key amendment .
I hope that , at the end of the debate , when all the speaker have contribute , I will once again be give the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendment .
Mr President , tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendment put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , a well a the amended version .
I propose to confine my comment to two area .
firstly there be the question a to what this directive be actually design to achieve , that be achieve in the real sense .
there be the fact that we have to take the interest of the economy and also of the individual into account .
my comment start from the premise that we be talk about an upright individual in gainful employment .
then there be the interest of the Member States , which , be on the receive end , may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario .
if we be go to abide by the one extreme , that be the interest of the Member States , then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdle that have to be clear in apply for this card relatively high .
there be also an argument for introduce early notification obligation a well a have this card .
if I be to go to the other extreme , a few hurdle a possible that be , then I would run the risk of fail to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive .
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place , but with the hurdle face the business world be so high , in reality no one would apply for the card.Alternatively , I might have no directive at all .
neither outcome would be satisfactory .
perhaps this be also why , a be rumour to be the case , the Council have become bogged down in it negotiation on this a well .
we have be try to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of find the easiest possible solution .
we want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdle be create vis-à-vis the business world , but once these have be overcome , implementation be a easy a it possibly could be .
therefore we want application for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States .
if a company in France say that it have an employee who have to work in Denmark on a permanent basis , and only in Denmark , then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark .
accordingly , the bureaucratic hurdle that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance .
in return for this , however , we want early notification obligation to be discontinue , rather it should just be a matter of the employee take the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them , and this might take the form of the contract form the basis for his / her posting .
consequently , I too have to say that I be in favour of the amendment put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
perhaps there be a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission .
we want to achieve a completely flexible solution .
if a particular Member State be to declare that it have suddenly run into problem because the individual concern have commit a theft and the card be for their country , then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card , a it be , for the reason cite in this directive , which be altogether a flexible and intelligent solution .
allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter .
most of those who have be work on the directive to date have be lawyer .
we all know that there be still various part of the Treaty , some of them very old , which be still refer to a EC .
we be aware that this directive be found on EC law and not on EU law .
however , before the election we - the Council , the Commission , Parliament , the press , union and company that be - worked towards make the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizen .
we have expect the citizen to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU .
they have now get to grip with & quot ; EU & quot ; .
we would be do neither ourselves nor the citizen any favour if we be to christen the product we be propose to deliver & quot ; EC service provision card & quot ; and not & quot ; EU service provision card & quot ; .
it be the world of the EU that the citizen be interested in , this be the one that count in their eye .
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction .
Mr President it be later than any of u think it would be when we be plan for this session so I shall be very brief indeed .
one of the reason why we be late be because we spend time earlier today rightly state the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism .
this directive be , of course , not in itself directly about that .
it be about attend to the need of the internal market , create flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country person both a employee and self-employed .
that be in itself also about avoid be unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she be a stranger .
we welcome that , and because we think it make a sensible and proper provision , we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carry out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally , which have incorporate innovative idea into this directive , which I hope will be approve by the Commission and the Council .
nevertheless , I have table an amendment .
Mrs Berger , in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6 , you mention legal security .
the first point on which we disagree be the duration of three month for the residency permit , since all that do be create legal insecurity .
you rightly raise the concern , also express by Mr Wieland , at the possibility of worker disappear into thin air when their work permit expire , but I think that we would be make this even more likely by bring in a three month permit .
if the validity of the service provision card expire on a certain date , it must end on that date .
legal security require this .
on the other hand , with regard to point d of Amendment No 10 , which refer to the first directive , you suggest that , for reason of public security or public order regulation , a Member State may reject the validity of the card .
there be already some ex ante control lay down in article 4 of the directive .
it make no sense for any worker within the Schengen area , since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State , and the second Member State would be justify in reject ex ante the entry of that worker into it territory .
it therefore make no sense to maintain that legal insecurity .
in the case of a non-Schengen state , in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22 , that possibility be contemplate , and be perfectly express , and I believe this provide greater legal security .
the discretional power of the State , which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10 , seem to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report .
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully , and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result .
on the face of it these two proposal appear to be implement certain procedural change to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court case Mrs Berger refer to in her opening remark .
however , in the case of the United Kingdom , we believe they go further than that in a manner which be unacceptable .
partly this be substance and partly it be in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom .
under the arrangement contain in the Treaties , the United Kingdom retain it border control .
under the system propose in these piece of legislation , third country national wish to move to the UK under the procedure describe , will do so by virtue of the service provision card issue by another Member State , thereby by-passing UK border control .
if there be to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangement , that change should be make by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process .
for that reason , we shall vote against both these proposal .
Mr President , Commissioner , first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the effort they have expend in sum up the various proposed amendment and interest in this report in such a balanced manner .
these two proposal contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principle of the internal market for the freedom to provide service .
the new regulation for cross-border service will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprise .
the strict basic condition attach to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I be with Mr Wieland on this - be essential , for they will serve to prevent abuse such a illegal entry and bogus contract .
why do I think we need the directive so much ?
three reason and they be a follow : on account of the economic importance of third-country worker in the EU , in the interest of the competitiveness of enterprise and the proper functioning of the internal market .
therefore , whilst I welcome the strict basic condition , I would also call for the control that be to be implement by the Member States to be make a effective and simple a possible .
my last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and be therefore addressed to the Commission.Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiation ?
how be Article 1 to be interpret and explain in your view , a this will have important implication , notably for the accession negotiation and for our country , which share common border with so many applicant country ?
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , businesspeople have so far have to live with the fact that two of the key freedom , namely the free movement of people and service , do not apply to them .
indeed , they be still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedure of the Member States where a service have to be provide .
there be approximately thirteen million third-country subject who reside within European territory .
I assume that , although the exact number of businesspeople include in this figure be not know , their number will most definitely not be low .
so , up to now , their access to the entire territory of the Union have not be regulate by Community legislation .
the aim of the two present proposal for a directive be to promote the free movement of service within the internal market by mean of introduce the EU service provision card .
it seem important , in this respect , to underline that the service provision card will be issue in a flexible manner , namely within five day of a simple declaration & apos ; s have be submit to a Member State where the service will be provide ; and that , also to prevent misuse , this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extend .
I have also pay close attention to the concern raise by the Commissioner .
have also study the amendment submit , I conclude that we can go along with these concern to a large extent and that this will be reflect in our voting behaviour tomorrow .
may I , to finish off , thank Mrs Berger for the great care she have take in study the different amendment and for have , in that way , add an important degree of meaning to her report ?
I think that , with this report , we be , once again , one step closer to the realisation of the internal market .
Mr President , thank you very much for the opportunity you be give me to go into the different amendment in more detail .
in the course of my speech , I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regard the remark he have just make .
regard the first proposal on third-country employee , the Commission be prepare to adopt Amendments Nos 2 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 and 22 .
amendment Nos 7 and 8 be acceptable too , provide the situation of posting be establish in the Member State in which the service provider be establish .
the Commission also agree with Amendment No 11 , except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three month , a I explain just now .
we also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar a , a a result of this , the card & apos ; s area of applicability be extend from one Member State to all Member States .
in term of comitology , Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part , insofar a the right of Parliament be concern .
I regret that the Commission have find Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable a far a the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service be provide be concern .
in this respect , the Commission support Amendment No 22 , a I have already mention .
the other amendment be unacceptable .
personally , I be rather in favour of the term & quot ; EU service provision card & quot ; which be propose in Amendment No 1 , but the Treaty of Amsterdam do not allow this .
a Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96 / 71 concern the minimum wage which be already in force , no change be necessary .
acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card be issue .
surely this be contrary to interest of public order within the Member States .
amendment No 19 be also unacceptable , give my thought on Amendment No 10 .
the Commission have the same opinion of similar amendment to the second proposal .
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal be wholly acceptable .
a far a Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term & quot ; self-employed & quot ; be concern , the Commission will , a I have already remark , provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objection lodge .
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood & apos ; s remark .
he refer to United Kingdom border control and I would like to say to him that Member States , and this include the United Kingdom , be under no obligation at all to abolish or change control at the exist border .
this apply , a already state , to the United Kingdom and it also apply to Belgium , where it be recently of relevance .
with regard to the remark make by Mr Karas , I be under the impression that he be talk about the possibility of people from Poland be use a employee in his country .
the Commission would like to propose find a solution to this problem which would then apply to all company base in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU country .
the question be , furthermore , one of whether the two case should be treat in the same way .
in my opinion , this be an issue which belong to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate .
on behalf of the Commission , I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point .
I will keep myself free in this connection .
finally , I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspect of these proposal and , in particular , of course , the rapporteur , Mrs Berger .
thank you very much , Commissioner Bolkestein .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m .
Court of First Instance
Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulate the rapporteur on a report , which , on read it , give the impression of simply confirm and accept the Council & apos ; s draft decision .
however , this report be base on long and effective work which have already produce certain result , such a the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency & apos ; s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation , composition and competence of the Community Courts .
for this reason , I would like to express my appreciation for the work carry out by Vice-President Marinho .
Mr President , the reform of the Community judicial system have become an essential requirement if , in the future , we intend justice to be do within reasonable time scale , and if , in the future , the European Union wish to have a judicial system which be equal to the political project which we have embark upon .
today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament have have a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project be much more than just an internal market , and that it be base much more on principle than on economic interest .
behind these principle , Mr President , lie the justice system .
however , justice delay be justice deny , and we must reflect on this notion .
the work document prepare by the Court itself contain alarm information .
for this reason , the draft reform , which have be draw up by the rapporteur , Vice-President Marinho , be to be welcome .
it be true that it be a stopgap solution , but we must rely on stopgap solution because , at the moment - a he himself have point out - we can not expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference .
we have to offer solution which , while provisional , help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice .
I would like to make two observation during this intervention , which stem from the report itself , give this Parliament & apos ; s obligation , in accordance with the Treaty , to produce a very succinct report , which do not go into depth .
these be two of Vice-President Marinho & apos ; s idea and , I believe , they be second by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
the first be that greater resource should be give to judge of first instance , and that they should be give one more référendaire .
the second be that the translation service of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separate .
at the moment , the Court of First Instance have to wait a very long time for it judgement to be translate .
accord to the Treaty , one of the founding principle of this Community be linguistic and cultural plurality and there be no question of our overlook the possibility of something a important a be able to read a judgement in our own language .
since we be talk about the Intergovernmental Conference , let u consider just two point .
the first concern this Parliament .
I believe that it be well worth insist that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice , even in the appointment of judge .
above all , we wish to see an extension of the competence of the Court of Justice , hand in hand with it capacity to fulfil it obligation , in other word , it resource .
we wish to see it competence extend , especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible option , certain clear limitation of protection in these area which be of extraordinary importance to our citizen .
and I refer once again to the declaration which we have hear in recent day .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the content of this report .
it have cause me to reflect on two problem which have come to me recently in my own constituency .
both concern case with decision pending before the Court of Justice .
the first relate to a large suspension bridge and whether or not toll on it should be subject to VAT .
the decision could have huge implication for our local economy .
secondly there be a lady within thirteen week of retirement who be desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstance in old age .
these be just two example of real life problem behind delay in Europe & apos ; s system of justice.Delays in justice can mean personal difficulty and even tragedy .
this be not to say that all of our own national system of justice be perfect , but all too often they may be wait for a preliminary ruling from the European Court .
amongst the statistic there be a worry upward trend in the time take to deal with preliminary reference .
this should not be take a a criticism of the Court or of it staff , rather of the Court & apos ; s structure and it lack of resource in a grow European Union .
the proposal in this report be very welcome a an interim palliative , but Europe be a legal construction , it court be central to it proper functioning .
in the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system .
otherwise we will all , a elect representative , be face with more and more clamour from our citizen who be not get access to quick and effective justice .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report .
I also fully endorse his finding , in which , in particular , he suggest increase the number of consultant for judge at the Court of First Instance and provide the latter with it own translation service .
however I also believe that the reform must go further than those we be to adopt here .
for example , I believe it be worth consider make the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance , if applicable , and make this a final competence , in those sphere where bench of the Court , which resemble court , pas judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plan be for European civil service law .
I be also aware that we be probably also go to have to do something about the European Commission & apos ; s inclination to renationalise competition decision and transfer them back to national level .
it seem to me that we need to give this some thought , a these case will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice a draft decision .
we need to consider how we will deal with situation of this kind .
where possible , one should also have the opportunity to present draft decision in competition case to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance .
on a final note , I too believe that OLAF require monitor under rule of law .
a thing stand , OLAF be in a vacuum and can do a it please .
it be essential for OLAF to be monitor by a court .
the only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance .
that would be another way of spur the reform process on .
Mr President , I would like to begin by join those who congratulate the rapporteur on this work .
the European Union be a system base on law .
it must therefore have a system of court to enforce that law .
furthermore , if the court can not deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload place on them , what happen , a Madame Palacio Vallelersundi have already point out , be that justice delay becomes , a we know , justice deny .
the evidence of the court be that that be happen now and it point to step which can be take now to alleviate the problem .
however , a Mr Marinho have point out , more be necessary , but that have to wait for the IGC ,
in my own country , mythology tell of the teem horde of faceless Brussels bureaucrat but it never mention the number of European judge .
there be le than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload give the responsibility of their task at the heart of the European legal system .
the extent of their importance can be see in the political implication of the delay in resolve the outstanding Anglo / French dispute over British beef which have cause such anger in my country and such frustration with the working of the Union & apos ; s dispute resolution procedure .
this have be compound , so some who advise me believe , by the Rules of Procedure in the French court which make it well nigh impossible for non-French national to proceed against the French Government .
certainly it be perceive de facto to be impossible .
this contrast most unfavourably with the United Kingdom court where Spanish fisherman successfully bring an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstance which be very comparable .
what be happen in France , Mr President , appear prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU national on ground of nationality and a such to be in breach of the Treaties .
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner , who be kind enough to make some comment about my remark in the previous debate , to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their finding .
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remark that he will do this .
Mr President , on behalf of Commission President , Mr Prodi , I would like to respond a follow .
may I add that , on behalf of the Commission , I listen with great interest to the plea which have be make just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlie these plea .
the unease be justified .
it have be say more than once : justice delayed be justice deny .
the Commission sympathise with these consideration .
in the light of this sympathy , I would like to continue my response a follow .
a your Parliament be aware , the Commission be convince that , without fundamental reform , the Community judicial body run the risk - in the short term - of no longer be able to carry out their task within reasonable deadline .
consequently , the Commission have ask for the advice of a group of expert regard the entirety of the reform which could be implement in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decade .
the Commission be aware of the request make by the Court of First Instance to increase it number of judge , but at the moment , the former be of the opinion that the propose transfer of competence should be see in the light of the study which I have just mention .
in other word , once this study be complete , the Commission will issue it opinion a soon a possible .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
exceptional financial aid to Kosovo
I have be inform that the rapporteur have be delay for several minute .
I propose that we start the debate immediately .
he will join u and speak a soon a he arrive .
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges , in his capacity a draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets .
Mr President , this be an important and urgent matter , and Parliament be comply with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly , because today , you must realise , men and woman be die in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature be 25 degree below zero , these people be do a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not be pay .
an urgent request have be refer to u , and we approve it .
we have be ask for EUR 35 million .
we agree that it may be grant and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensure , once the decision have be take , that the amount be set aside and pay a quickly a possible .
we be talk about macrofinancial aid .
there be reaction to this in some quarter since it do not comply with the liberal canon of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration .
this be not our opinion .
our opinion be that it be vital to contribute to set up an administration in Kosovo and that it be by no mean absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employee in this region .
indeed that be something extremely useful that we could have do in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state .
the second important problem be that we have be ask for payment , the donor have make commitment and , obviously , we be the only one actually pay .
the other party be not pay .
we wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regard request for financial aid .
we would like the Commission to make commitment on the amendment we be propose in regard to this .
we would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amount due from the other donor .
this be not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but , quite the contrary , to ensure that our contribution be be match by the contribution of other donor .
from that point of view , the propose facility be a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be release a soon a the donor have make clear their interest .
finally , we have three question for the Commission in this regard.Firstly , we need the Commission to give u , on a regular basis , the list and the amount that other donor contribute .
when we come to pay , we want to know what the others be pay .
secondly , we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitation to tender and the schedule for their implementation .
during the budgetary procedure we be tell that the fund for Kosovo must be vote on a a matter of urgency yet , accord to our information , no invitation to tender have be publish or initiate to date .
this be serious , since it hold up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo .
finally , and this follow on from what I have just say , we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis , monthly , regard progress on payment make .
we have Commission document which speak of firm commitment .
it be not firm commitment that we need , just plain commitment would suffice , and we need to know what have actually be pay and , more especially , what have not be pay .
Kosovo have suffer far too much from delay in payment .
Mr President , if we be go to discuss Kosovo today , a we have do many time before , then we should also start by take stock of what have actually already be do in Kosovo , or of whether in fact anything have be do at all .
what I mean to say be that a few small step have already be make along the path to normality , and it would be nice if they could at least be list in the course of such a debate .
a of 9 February , there will be something know a the Kosovo Transitional Council , which will comprise representative of the political party , the minority and civil society , and which be intend to be a quasi interim parliament .
this be a positive move and we welcome it , but I believe we need to equip the individual concern with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they be actually go to have to prepare , for election be plan for the autumn .
no one really know what these election be to lead to and what kind of parliament be to be form a a result .
no one know what kind of authority this parliament be go to have vis-à-vis UNMIK .
in other word , there be quite a few imponderable that we be not be inform about and that others be presumably unable to get to grip with properly either .
of all people , it be the Albanians , who be now be integrate into the transitional council , who ought in fact to have a little more idea a to what be in store for them .
in addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work , urgent attention must also be give to restore the coexistence of Serbs , Albanians and other minority - not forget the Roma of course - in this country , so that at some point in the near future , on the road to coexistence , it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place .
I would like to list again the thing that have actually already be accomplish and that we can be please about .
Administration-wise there be now 34 tax inspector .
that be excellent news !
there too , people be be encourage to pay their tax , for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handout from the EU and from other donor ; some of the money for these activity must come from their own resource .
it should also be note that of the 19 department , 4 already have administrative leadership , which represent an improvement on the situation there hitherto .
there be something else that we be keen to develop and this be very important for a state under the rule of law.We have 130 judge and public prosecutor , who have now be swear in , and who be ready to take up their work of dispense justice , with a view to enrich the culture of tolerance there a little , and to at least be able to track criminal down and then secure conviction .
another positive development I would like to remind you of be the fact that the old UCK be now bind up in the reconstruction of the country .
I believe that be a good thing
I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets have to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donor to at long last pay their way .
the EU Commission can not pay for everything .
it be responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar , but it can not constantly be call upon to pay Mr Kouchner & apos ; s outstanding bill .
one could do so once or twice , but I feel that the UN donor should contribute to this a well , for there be a very large hole , a yet unfilled , that we be unable to fill .
we have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judge accord to how we fulfil it .
Mr President , I would like to offer a few explanation .
in a debate , there be always the danger that we will repeat much of what have already be say .
however , I would like to concentrate on two point .
firstly , I would like to make it very clear that the Union be the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo .
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press be true , and that figure do not lie .
let u make this clear , however much some people may not wish to believe it .
the Union have decide to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo , on the basis of an IMF report which estimate that a further EUR 115 million be need for that reconstruction .
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I be in complete agreement with her when she say that the Commission should insist that other contributor fulfil their commitment .
I would also like to express my concern - which be very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that say that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter , in any circumstance , the financial perspective agree in Berlin .
this call into question the agreement which Parliament reach , with great difficulty , with the Council in December , accord to which , when the Commission present a multiannual programme for reconstruction , the financial perspective would be review where necessary .
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which be really very difficult to reach .
I would like to ask the Commission - and I be glad that Commissioner Solbes be here with u this even - to present u in time with this multiannual finance programme , with the corresponding report , request by Parliament , so that it may be take into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget be draw up , a we have be promise .
lastly , I would like to insist that , although we have agree to EUR 35 million now , we know that this be a stopgap solution and that it be not enough , and we should therefore reach an agreement a soon a possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo , which be so badly need .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , please excuse my late arrival , but this other political issue be still on the agenda today , more be the pity .
the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million , and this piece of advice be give because this money can truly benefit those in need .
the thing that have give u cause for criticism be not so serious a to stop u want to help the people there .
however , this do not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process .
of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration have not forget to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official document .
only then would we have be able to conduct proper and searching discussion .
I urge the administration to see to it that this do not happen in future .
it be only because there be people in need that we be prepared to overlook this .
however , we must be sure to introduce certain condition here .
one condition be that money should be give to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursue other aim .
in other word , we should ensure that the money fall to Mr Kouchner & apos ; s sphere of competence and not to other sphere .
secondly , even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problem there , we believe that the other donor must also fulfil the obligation they have enter into .
this mission be be conduct under the auspex of the United Nations and we can not have a situation where the European Union be the only one to fulfil it obligation .
it be no le incumbent on the other donor country to fulfil their obligation within this timeframe , in the interest of the person affect .
this bring me onto the point that in future we be go to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general term , that be to say , not just with this specific project but with overall development in south-east Europe , and with the aid deliver there .
this be another example of the fact that the European Union be prepare to help and to give money but the political leadership lack coherence .
we have so many coordinator , who , in turn , be responsible to so many employer , that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinator .
perhaps it would be better , however , if the position of responsibility within the European Union and the other institution from the OSCE to the United Nations , be to get together some time to introduce a uniform , coordinate procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there .
I know that the Commission be think seriously about how to achieve this , but if the European Union be do the most work out there , then it should also be give the leadership , and bring coherence to the situation , so that we can be of real assistance to the people .
it make no sense at all for the various international institution and association to be engage in competition amongst themselves rather than invest all their energy in help the people on the ground !
Mr President , when the Alliance intervene in Kosovo it objective be to re-establish condition in this province which would enable those who wish to do so to stay there or return , with respect for their own heritage and their own culture .
if the Alliance be still active in that region , it be with the same objective .
the day before yesterday I be pleased to hear an interview give by the KFOR commander show how much better matter in connection with this in Kosovo be start to be , particularly a regard security , crime level have be restore to an acceptable level .
those represent Europe who be active at the grass root level in pursue this objective , and I be think in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , be on the verge of despondency precisely because , since matter be improve , there be le talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which be need there be become le apparent .
we must work to ensure that , in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally , the rule of shopkeeper follow the rule of the warlord .
it be true that economic aid be , in this respect , certainly an essential element to the scope of action afford those people active at the grass root level .
let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack have just make and stress that we , the Members of the European Parliament , must fulfil our own obligation in this regard , while ensure , of course , that we be not the only one to do so .
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Brok , for his report .
if the Council have work a quickly a Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on .
the Council & apos ; s failing in this respect be a source of much regret .
the rapporteur and the report be right to start from the premise that we should , and must , provide help swiftly , however it be also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random .
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point , which clearly emphasise that it be only possible , and permissible , to use the fund from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirement arise from public or semi-public , communal and other authority and institution , which be control either directly or indirectly by UNMIK .
Commissioner , it must be make clear that we support UNMIK and the institution set up by the United Nations , in particular Pillar 4 of course , and it will not do for u to support the parallel structure that have form in Kosovo and be still in place .
what be to be do with this money ?
I would like to highlight the issue of human right .
the West fought for human right in Kosovo and what be happen there today ?
we be able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carry out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable thing happen : people be kill , people be prevent from live there or be prevent from live their life a they see fit .
every single day there be attack on Serbs , on the Roma , on Bosnians , but attack be also still carry out on Albanians .
I be in fact shock to read in the report , assume this be true , how an Albanian doctor , who be work in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have be great difficulty , ultimately have to give up help his kinsman in this hospital because there be constant threat on his life .
these be event and situation that can not be tolerate .
I hear - whether it be true or not I do not know - that the Serbs be even continue to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo .
there be , at the very least , rumour that Serbian militia be up to their old trick again .
it be irrelevant , a far a I be concerned , a to whether it be Serbs , Roma , Bosnians or Albanians who be threaten or kill in Kosovo .
it be also irrelevant , in my view , a to who be work towards separation and division in Kosovo .
what be all-important , to my mind , be that the body we be finance should achieve what we want them to achieve , a multi-ethnic Kosovo that be , a Kosovo where people can live together .
we need more police officer , a we have nowhere near enough .
we need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish - , we also need fund for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights .
all of this need to happen , and quickly too .
if we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflict and crisis situation may arise .
that be why I believe that we be right to take action quickly , to recognise the urgency of the situation and make fund available .
only , now we want to see this translate into deed and we also want to see success in Kosovo , and I would urge the Commission to see that these fund be put to good use , notably for build up the police force and for establish the judiciary .
. ( ES ) Mr President , I would like firstly to thank the Members , and especially the rapporteur , for the speed with which they have deal with this issue .
this will no doubt allow u to release the fund for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concern which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mention .
I think I have see three type of fundamental concern in tonight & apos ; s debate .
firstly , although much progress have be make , and we could mention custom administration , bank administration or tax administration , it be true that we must continue to move forward .
however , in move forward , what should we be finance ?
this be the first point on which there be a certain amount of disagreement .
in some of your amendment you propose that we limit further the type of body which can be provide with Union fund , for example , Amendments Nos 3 and 5 .
in our view , however , in both respect , greater room for manoeuvre should be leave to the administration of the United Nations which , on the ground , be more aware of the reality than we be .
we believe that to prejudge , at the moment , where resource should be direct , would create more practical difficulty .
in short , we should put our faith in those party who , in these area , be better equip than u to make certain decision .
the second concern which I notice that many of you share - it be first express by Mr Bourlanges , but others have repeat it - refers to the situation regard the other donor .
be the Commission make an excessive effort while others be fail to cooperate ?
some of the amendment in your report pose this question .
for example , Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 4 .
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raise this issue , that this be not the fundamental problem , although we recognise it totally .
the fundamental problem be that , at the moment , the distribution of the burden amongst the different donor have be establish in the statement of the High Level Steering Group , but it be also true that they have no legal status.This be simply a political commitment .
that be the reason why , while accept it spirit , we would ask that Amendment No 1 be word differently - and we have send a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it do not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resource .
I would say the same about Amendment No 2 , which we would also accept with a slight modification , since the idea seem to u to be basically correct .
amendment No 4 be of a similar nature .
on this specific point , we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction .
we have already speak to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in it decision , establish this element of conditionality .
with regard to the second contribution , what we propose be that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decide in accordance with the external financial need of Kosovo and the contribution of other bilateral donor .
in other word , we should not establish conditionality , or we believe that it be more effective not to establish conditionality from the start , but , nevertheless , we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage .
in this way , we would have no problem in act immediately.We would not create problem for the Kosovar people , but , on the other hand , we would force the other donor to make their financial contribution in the way that we be do .
a third problem have be raise by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programme .
I would remind you that these project be multiannual .
the programme clearly have to take the annual budgetary contribution into account .
lastly , I would like to make some observation on the request for additional information which have be address to u .
on the one hand , we have be ask to provide Parliament with information regard the progress of invitation to tender and , in this respect , I can tell you that the Commission be last week able to provide Parliament & apos ; s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contract and payment carry out since the task force be send into action in Kosovo .
the Commission can commit itself to regularly inform Parliament of the invitation to tender which be publish .
we also wish to see these publicise on the Internet , so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point .
a second point which I would like to comment on be the remain information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance .
in this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission be prepare to keep the chairman of the various committee involve in this area regularly inform , on a confidential basis , if the nature of the information provide require confidentiality , on the different scheme be implement for macroeconomic assistance .
thank you very much , lady and gentleman , and I hope that , with the final decision of the Council , we can release these fund and make a positive contribution to maintain the considerable effort be make in Kosovo by different party , so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see .
Mr President , I be pleased to see the convergence of viewpoint there be between Parliament , particularly the Committee on Budgets , and the Commission , and we can assure you that , for our part , we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of it duty .
I do , however , have one small concern , when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitment make by their service in the Committee on Budgets .
but , if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira say correctly , then this undertaking be only a tentative one .
Commissioner , an agreement be an agreement .
can you confirm the agreement make by your service in the Committee on Budgets , yes or no ? or be you go to drop this proviso , thus break the undertaking make to u ?
no , Mr Bourlanges , I think it be a substantive problem .
the problem be how in practical term to implement the compromise which we accept .
what I propose to you , and what I still say , be that the Commission will make a statement , in the Council Decision , something like this :
the exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decide in due course take into account development in Kosovo & apos ; s external financing need and contribution from other bilateral donor .
with this , we believe that we be totally in line with what we agree .
I be simply ask the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implement the second tranche .
I agree , absolutely.We shall do so .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
ALTENER
the next item be the report ( A5-0011 / 2000 ) by Mr Langen , on the joint text approve by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopt a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy source in the Community - Altener ( C5-0333 / 1999 - 1997 / 0370 ( COD ) )
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he be not actually here - for the work he have do to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council .
the project have be long and problematic .
in future too , there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy source .
although there be much that be good about the new directive , it be nonetheless not without it defect .
one example be the use of peat .
peat can not be classify a belonging in the same group a fossil fuel .
if peat can not be classify directly a a renewable , non-fossil energy source , it must form it own class , especially a far a the issue of environmental taxation be concern .
it be not right that peat should be judge accord to the same criterion a , for example , coal .
the development of renewable energy source be a partial solution to end the Union & apos ; s dependence on import energy .
research be particularly essential with regard also to the EU & apos ; s next round of enlargement .
dependence on import energy affect worst of all many Eastern European country , whose economic structure be still suffer from the dependence create in the time of the Soviet Union on Russian energy .
the EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate .
we be all concern about the environment and our child & apos ; s future .
the share that renewable energy source have in total energy production must be increase , but it have to be do in a rational manner .
we have to remember that our basic energy production can not be base on renewables for a long time to come .
for that we need a form of energy production that do not harm the climate : nuclear energy .
Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I welcome the fact that we have reach an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme .
firstly , however , I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Langen , for the truly excellent work he have do on this report .
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee , Mr Provan .
for a Mr Langen say just now , we certainly have a tough fight on our hand in the Conciliation Committee .
however , we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bear the trademark of the European Parliament throughout .
Mr Langen mention that a series of Parliament & apos ; s demand and point it have to make relate to content be adopt and - a have already be mention - we be almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point , that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy source in the Community .
this be not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear .
however , we agree to this compromise because it be important to u to enable this programme to be launch very soon indeed .
for in the course of the next few year , the proportion of renewable energy source be to double , account for at least 12 % of energy consumption .
this be the European Union & apos ; s declare aim .
that be the case , since ALTENER be the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promote renewable energy source , it will certainly be have a key role .
in the first place , this new five-year programme will entail extend the action in the ALTENER I programme.This will include extend the exchange of information and expertise between operator in the renewable energy source sector , develop local and regional energy agency , and establish new network for approve financial support , to name but a few example .
to my mind though , what be particularly important about the ALTENER II programme be the new action for relieve market saturation by renewable energy and those for implement , support and monitor the Community strategy and the Community action plan .
we now have available to u a work paper from the Commission & apos ; s service on a breakthrough campaign , which be in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy .
it contain plan for financial support for all the main renewable energy source sector .
it be very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it .
the overall investment cost for this campaign be estimate to be approximately EUR 30 billion .
75 % -80 % of this be to come from private source , and this will be supplement by public fund from the Member States and from the region .
in this respect , the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentive and smooth the way for investment , and help u to realise our ambition , in the interest of environmental protection , the economy and create new job .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent work in this important matter .
the conclusion reach regard conciliation with regard to the Altener programme a put forward by the Conciliation Committee be , after all the difficult phase it have be through , at least satisfactory .
most of Parliament & apos ; s amendment have be take into account and the fact that the programme have see it total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be see a positive .
the Union have ambitious goal with regard to increase the use of renewable energy .
there be very little in the way of appropriation to meet these target , however .
the appropriation be need for pilot project , research , information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitude towards the use of renewable energy .
the main responsibility for increase the use of renewables be to be bear by the Member States .
this programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy .
however , in the future , the Union will also have to increase it own input in promote the use of renewable energy and ensure that renewable energy be launch without obstacle on the market .
promote the use of renewables be especially important for the environment .
the Union can not achieve it environmental goal unless the use of renewables be actively step up .
renewable energy source lower dependency on import energy and their increase use boost competitiveness .
Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supply equipment need for the exploitation of renewable energy .
we should also remember that the use of renewable energy source have a positive impact on regional development and employment .
may I also venture to raise the matter of peat ?
peat be not mention in the list of renewable energy source .
however , it be important , at least in Finland , a a sustainably use , slowly renewable energy source .
I hope that in the future it can be include in the list of renewables .
Commissioner , lady and gentleman , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance be please with the agreement which have be find , and their thanks go to all those who negotiate so well in favour of an amendment which the Greens be almost the author of .
it be interest for me , a a new Member of Parliament , to see that the budget provide for hundred of million of euro annually for tobacco cultivation .
this be a limited sector of the economy which create hardly any job and be not competitive on the world scale .
in contrast with that , I see the amount allocate for renewable energy , which be not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion .
see the market share that small country such a Denmark have be capable of acquire in this field , because they be the first one to develop that area , give one food for thought , I feel , and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budget for renewable energy .
one last word regard the programme.I think it very important for renewable energy to be firmly establish in the region so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there .
in order to ensure that at least 50 % of the energy mix come from renewable energy source , it be not enough to deal with a few hot spot that will be more profitable in the short term .
Mr President , may I commence by compliment Mr Langen on his work .
the activity of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy source and I believe that such programme merit financial support at the developmental stage a they offer enormous commercial potential in the future .
for this reason , I be particularly pleased to see the monies focus on project by small and medium-sized enterprise .
the internationally agreed objective for reduce emission can not be achieve by these programme alone .
in this regard , it must be remember that energy policy remain within the national remit .
it be imperative that national government lend their full support to improve energy efficiency and develop renewables .
I be pleased that Ireland have recently announce that it be go to spend £ 125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector .
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiative .
a the final text rightly state , action such a these can play a role in reduce regional disparity .
I can vouch that I have already receive significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster , a significant portion of which fall within Ireland & apos ; s only Objective I region .
I support all effort to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provision , include the energy sector .
in short , we face a major challenge in meet our commitment on limit greenhouse gas emission from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol , while at the same time promote growth in our economy .
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combine effort of the Member States .
Mr President , Mr Langen , lady and gentleman , a our rapporteur mention , we be come to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme .
Mr Langen mention that the implementation budget propose by the Council be initially FF 74 million , whereas the Commission propose 81.1 million , a figure which the European Parliament support .
an initial conciliation meeting be not successful , because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million .
we could not agree with a proposal like this , which challenge the authority of the European Parliament .
a second round of conciliation achieve an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million .
in fact , renewable energy unquestionably provide a way of achieve these objective .
however , in spite of the reservation I be express on the paucity of the financial allocation , I personally support the compromise , by virtue of the programme & apos ; s content , to which the European Parliament make an active contribution a , follow the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty , this sector become subject to codecision .
it be practically certain that , with the raft of propose measure and action , it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12 % renewable energy share by 2010 , double the current rate , a long a the appropriation include state appropriation be make available .
this programme , together with the SAVE II programme , integrate the environmental aspect into energy policy , establish a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reduce our dependence .
and , in conclusion , Mr President , let me also insist upon the fact that , in addition to the measure propose , there be also legislative measure and , most especially , adequate budget allocation to back up these political initiative .
and I shall end , of course , by congratulate Mr Langen , our rapporteur , on his work , a well a all the member of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee .
. ( ES ) Mr President , lady and gentleman , firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reach on the ALTENER II programme in the Conciliation Committee and associate myself with the comment of the different speaker and , of course , point out that this agreement will allow the ALTENER programme to be incorporate soon into the framework energy programme .
all of this will provide greater coordination , transparency and efficiency in our energy programme , into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme , which we will be discuss soon .
I would like to say that the work carry out during this time by Parliament have be of a high quality , and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Langen and also all the various speaker who have speak both in committee and here in plenary .
obviously , there have be argument , we have to go to conciliation , a the rapporteur and Mr Caudron remind u a moment ago , since at the first meeting no result be achieve , and there have to be a second meeting , despite the fact that the figure be not excessive .
however , I believe that in the end we have reach a reasonable agreement , which , like all agreement , be perhaps not perfect , but which , I believe , allow u to push ahead with the project with which we be deal .
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Langen , on his work , to thank the speaker and , of course , to acknowledge the action of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure , who contribute efficiently to the achievement of a positive result .
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council .
save
the next item be the report ( A5-0010 / 2000 ) by Mrs Ahern , on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approve by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopt a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE ( C5-0334 / 1999 - 1997 / 0371 ( COD ) ) .
Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that be good-tempered all round , which be not always the case .
I be happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation a very satisfactory for Parliament a the joint text have incorporate all it amendment either in full or in a re-worded form .
the financial amount finally allocate to the programme be also a considerable improvement on the Council & apos ; s proposal at second reading which we find completely unacceptable and we have make quite a lot of progress there .
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposal on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading .
I would like to remind the House that at second read Parliament adopt this report contain eight amendment , include a re-instatement of the Commission & apos ; s original budget .
the Commission accept five of the propose amendment include the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure a what the Council have propose be unacceptable .
during the procedure , agreement be reach on the study and action to devise , implement , complement and assess the Community measure .
compromise wording be agree for five other amendment include legislative and non-legislative measure and the inclusion of local energy centre and , very importantly , the energy audit system in the review of progress on energy efficiency .
I hope that you will all agree that this be important progress .
the issue of the financial envelope be staunchly defend by Parliament in the face of the Council & apos ; s very meagre opening offer .
in the event we have to have several meeting before the Council finally increase this to a substantial amount .
we get an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which be a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirm that it could implement the programme under .
this be an important consideration for u .
I would like to say however that it be , and have always be , a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme be more symbolic than real .
funding for energy saving still come primarily from the Member States .
we have to bear that in mind when approve this programme .
if there be more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level , this be a pity because there be a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action , include Community action , on energy saving .
where the Community can step in be to put the local activator in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region .
we have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard .
save be the only Community-wide programme dedicate to promote the rational use of energy .
it focus on non-technical element , help to build energy efficiency infrastructure , and the purpose of the programme be to create an environment in which investment and energy efficiency will be promote .
here we need to realise that there be also a market opportunity in industry for energy saving .
we have hear a lot about difficulty of competition in renewable energy but energy efficiency save money for business , save money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical .
it be something that we can all support .
I have to say , like motherhood , although we all support it , sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mother or the people engage in energy-saving .
we could do rather more , consider that we have make great commitment in reduce CO2 and greenhouse gas and to reduce dependence on energy import .
we be not take the kind of action that the citizen want to see .
we be not make the connection so that the citizen can actually do something concretely either at home or in their office or in industry to support action against global climate change .
if we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do .
I would like once again to thank all who help in this conciliation process .
a Mrs Ahern have explain very well , the budget of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme , be basically symbolic budget , since the burden be shoulder by the country , the States of the Union , the region or even , in some case , the local authority .
furthermore , behind these programme , that be to say , the SAVE programme , which concern greater efficiency and energy saving , and the Altener programme , which concern renewable energy , there lie an extremely important technological challenge , which , from an economic point of view , may offer significant opportunity to industry and also for the creation of job in our country and therefore in the Union a a whole .
with regard to the parliamentary procedure , I would like once again to thank all of those who have act and speak , especially the rapporteur , because the majority of Parliament & apos ; s amendment have be incorporate into the proposal accept by the Council , in this case practically all of them , although with some modifications.I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of fund have be achieve .
this improvement have be achieve with fresh fund , a we say at the time , and it have be achieve while safeguard this Parliament & apos ; s prerogative and competence .
from the point of view of the Commission , in this interinstitutional game , I believe that this be important and I be very happy to highlight it .
I would like once again to thank all the speaker , and also , especially , the Vice-President , Mr Provan , for his magnificent work throughout this debate , particularly during the conciliation procedure , a well a the chairman of the Committee on Industry and , also , above all , the rapporteur , Mrs Ahern , and all the Members who have participate in this work .
thank you , Commissioner .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
culture 2000
Madam President , I actually feel that we ought not to have continue discuss this because we say everything there be to say in the last debate .
unfortunately , there have be no change in the way that the Council always talk about culture but fail to allocate any money for it .
we have the feeling , and be in fact convince , that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the thing they write in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht .
for no one be very keen to spend money on culture .
sadly that be the case and we must face fact .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , who really have chip away tirelessly at this monumental task , in conjunction with the Commissioner of course .
we simply have to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attain our goal in term of content , of course the same could not be say of the financial aspect .
one seem powerless in a dialogue of this kind , where the other party actually have to reach a unanimous decision .
what kind of horse-trading system be this ?
certainly not a fair one ! there be always people who be in a position to reject everything and there we be on the other side , beg for a little more money for culture .
it be downright scandalous what go on !
it be an awful sort of horse-trading , base on unequal position !
nevertheless , we be pleased that this programme have turn out in the way that we want it to .
it live up to the expectation the citizen have of u .
we will support small and medium-sized event , not the large one , and we will afford individual citizen and also the smaller operator easier access .
I believe that the fact that Culture and , fittingly , Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner & apos ; s remit , will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programme , which be certainly worthwhile programme for the citizen of the European Union .
if one put all the money together and create synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied , but then only a tiny bit .
it be my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money .
Madam President , I agree with the fine word with which the rapporteur begin his intervention and I must add that , during the conciliation procedure , I be personally a little disappointed with the Council .
on the one hand , it continue to refuse to accept the term & quot ; European cultural policy & quot ; or other similar term , even undervalue the term of the Treaty , and it define & quot ; Culture 2000 & quot ; simply a an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more .
on the other hand , it have show complete intransigence with regard to the fund request by this Parliament , which be minimal anyway .
incidentally , this last point would be unfair to fourteen Members of the Council , since it be just one , the Netherlands , which be responsible for that intransigence .
it have once again be demonstrate that conciliation be incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council .
this demand make conciliation almost impossible and even affect the dignity of the parliamentary institution .
however , Madam President , these consideration must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow , and which the Socialists will vote in favour of , will put in place one of the European Union & apos ; s most important programme .
by take action in the field of culture , we be directly contribute to the construction of a European soul , especially give the fact that the sub-programmes which make up & quot ; Culture 2000 & quot ; be superb .
in recent year , these have be amongst the programme most eagerly accept by the youngest and most dynamic citizen of the European Union .
lastly , I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have form of the rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura : his knowledge , his sense of balance , his intellectual quality , make him , in my opinion , the best possible rapporteur this report could have have .
congratulation !
finally , I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding , Vice-President Imbeni and Mr Gargani , chairman of the Committee on Culture , for the firm and intelligent position which , each within his own role , they have maintain during the entire conciliation process .
Madam President , Commissioner , rapporteur , I would like to start by thank Mr Graça Moura most warmly for the tremendous effort he have put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme .
it have be say before , and we have discuss this between ourselves on various occasion , that culture be , of course , extremely important a an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also a the instrument par excellence for further the European idea .
it be also of great importance to citizen .
we should , above all , not lose sight of this.The impetus give to the European idea by this programme be have an enormous impact , especially on small linguistic area such a the Netherlands which not only have national potential , but be also rely on support from the programme , mainly from a language point of view .
today , we have arrive at the end of a long road .
I would nonetheless like , a others have do , to touch upon the procedure , which be unclear and , above all , unwanted .
codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand .
they be like a snake bite it own tail .
there be little room for negotiation if one of the party state beforehand : anything be open for discussion , a long a the budget stay fix .
a it happen - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiation on this matter have take place at an earlier stage .
the result be 30 % growth , so we be not completely dissatisfy with the result .
of course , it be always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme open up good opportunity for quite a few programme .
I would like to stress that culture be not only fund from this particular pot .
culture do not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kind of other area .
a great deal of money for culture be also set aside in the Structural Funds , and this be something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind .
fortunately , I be on the Committee on Regional Policy .
so I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention .
I think that we have also opt in favour of allow the budget to be of an adequate size because , if it happen to be cancel , then surely this do not benefit the citizen .
I have always give the rapporteur my backing in this respect .
however , I do think that it be necessary , a he always state too , that , in the next IGC , change will be make to codecision , when unanimity will no longer be necessary .
we be very positive about the many improvement which have be make : no more mega-projects , room for cultural network , and sufficient attention to promote reading , translate and translation company .
this be especially important to smaller linguistic areas.I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000 .
all that remain for me to say be : time to get down to business .
Madam President , all that I want to say have be cover by those fellow Members who speak before me and I think there be unanimity among the group in the European Parliament and among those of u on the Committee on Culture .
I too must say that I will be vote for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart .
not because our delegation , our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani do not work exceptionally well - they work very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding & apos ; s attitude - I think that , give the framework she be operate in , her attitude be particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopt by the Council .
it be shameful !
that figure of EUR 167 million for so many year be a disgrace for the European Union !
so long a we continue to have unanimity , so long a yesterday the Dutch Government be able to impose those EUR 167 million a an ultimatum and so long a a government with Mr Haider will soon be tell u what cultural activity we can pursue , we will never progress .
that be why it be very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decision and to cut free so that the European Parliament & apos ; s effort to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the government .
Madam President , I absolutely agree with the rapporteur & apos ; s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture , Mr Gargani , for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that be also , considerably difficult .
of course , we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programme , but everyone hop that the Culture programme could help to promote , for example , the unique feature of each cultural sector , even - and I could say especially - of the unique feature of le well-known sector .
we hope that this , at the least , will come about during the evaluation process .
we sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action , among other thing in term of make a contribution to the social , a well a economic , development of a people .
and a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover it root , highlight it common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic island that until now be le well-known .
the overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of be European citizen : this be why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme , albeit with a scarcity of fund , can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal .
Madam President , I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , who take over from our former colleague Nana Mouskouri .
both of them have do a first-class job .
alongside the debate we have earlier on in the day , culture may not seem that important , but it be ; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important .
why do I say that culture be important ?
well in simple economic term , Europe & apos ; s culture add to genuine prosperity .
where would Europe & apos ; s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture ?
but , more importantly than that , cultural activity be what make mankind civilise .
culture be at the root of our democratic belief ; and an uncultured society be not go to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy .
cultural diversity be important , and it be under threat .
however , it be not under threat from Europe .
many people in my country say they see British culture be under threat , for example , from Portugal , from Germany , from Finland , for heaven & apos ; s sake .
we do drink port wine , and we do like German beer , and we even use Finnish sauna , but it be not from Europe that culture be under threat .
what I do see right across Europe be people drink Coca Cola , eat hamburger , wear baseball cap , watch Hollywood film and often do all this at the same time .
now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation be the way of defend Europe & apos ; s culture , but I do believe in lend a help hand when we can .
that be what Culture 2000 be about .
so , I say to the Council of Ministers : keep this programme genuinely under review .
be we do enough ?
and , I say to Madame Reding , thank you for the support and the help you have give so far , keep up the good work , we be on your side .
Madam President , I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur , Graa Moura , and Commissioner Reding , for their contribution to the creation of this programme .
the Culture 2000 programme be finalise at the end of last year a a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council .
the outcome can be consider reasonable , when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme call for a unanimous decision to be make in the Council .
we have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decision in the area of culture .
it be really strange that legislation that adhere to the codecision procedure when it be be debate require unanimity for it to be pass in the Council .
the framework programme on culture be replace the present Kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael programme .
when implementation of the programme begin , I hope in particular that the scope it offer for literature and the translation of book can be utilise to the full.I believe and hope that , despite the assault on u all of the new technology , literature will maintain it status .
we need the depth of spirit that literature provide in the midst of a culture that have a short attention span and be incline towards the superficial .
literature likewise play an important part in the way it transmit our cultural heritage , increase mutual familiarity and preserve linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongue .
in this connection , I be very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 program get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon , the country hold the presidency of the EU be to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public library .
I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of library into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society .
Madam President , Commissioner , rapporteur , lady and gentleman , somehow or other , today & apos ; s agenda have come full circle .
we have have a great deal to say today about Europe a a community of value , about tolerance , human dignity , human right , a positive approach to the enlargement process , transparency and respect for each other .
youth , education and cultural policy be important tool for create these value , for give the citizen confidence in the European Union and make it credible in their eye .
the funding approve by the Council for the cultural programme do not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union & apos ; s goal .
cultural activity create identity .
cultural activity be an expression of individuality , of an individual & apos ; s own personality ; it build relationship and communicates .
we want a colourful Europe .
we want a Europe base on the principle of diversity within unity .
we want people to understand and learn to appreciate difference .
that be why we speak in favour of break down the budget , the allocation of fund that be , into the different type of measure .
that be why we oppose concentrate heavily on large network and network structure , because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entity and activity perform by individual ; because we want to see thousand of flower bloom .
I would like to second what the previous speaker have to say .
there be a contradiction in term - unanimity principle , codecision procedure , and Conciliation Committee - and it be one we must resolve if we want to strengthen , and not further weaken the principle of cultural policy that be to create a European consciousness .
Madam President , a we have hear , all the group have a common political enemy in the Council .
it be not by chance that the Committee on Culture & apos ; s decision be constantly end up in the conciliation procedure , for one or other Member State in the Council always hold culture hostage to other interest .
in this way , the unanimity principle have show itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order .
the battle for a workable compromise last almost two year , and now , at long last , the European Parliament can give the go-ahead .
the Council could not be move , not even when the precursor program Kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael finish .
a pilot programme be call for to bridge the gap .
this show up the weakness of the European Union & apos ; s cultural policy activity once again .
the political fight over funding and programme structuring be out of all proportion to the volume of support .
out of 410 application in 1999 only 55 project with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be consider .
the Council be not prepare in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro !
and so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004 .
that be the same a a single , medium-sized , German opera house & apos ; s expenditure over the same period , when here in Europe this sum have be earmark for 29 country over a period of five year !
there be a blatant discrepancy here !
and so we be go to have to be content , albeit very grudgingly , with the fact that we have at least manage to achieve something in term of content .
previous speaker have already kindly point this out .
we can only hope that it will , after all , be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day .
perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activity do the European Union good , not harm !
cultural cooperation - and this be also mention earlier - truly create identity , far more so than any transport directive , however important it might be .
provide support for culture meet with wide-spread acceptance , and this certainly can not be say of all policy decision .
what , may I ask , be the Council afraid of ?
Madam President , whoever have the honour , like myself , to chair the Committee on Culture , can not fail to agree with the comment from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur , and Commissioner Reding , with whom he work and who , even during the conciliation process , have difficult moment and oppose the Council - you have hear this say by everyone .
I have notice how the principle of a necessary culture at European organisational level have be firmly assert , but there be few opportunity to address all the request that the European States will make .
I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because , in the end , we do not manage to adopt a review clause .
however , Mrs Reding be certainly receptive and farsighted , and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few year , and therefore to change the situation .
this be not rhetoric , but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unite the European States and constitute a turning point for the European Parliament and the Commission .
man and culture be priority , and culture can result in economic growth .
let u contemplate this result , derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy .
Madam President , may I first thank Mr Graça Moura for weave his way through the rather tough textile and fibre that have make up this conciliation tapestry .
it seem to me when enter the conciliation process for Culture 2000 , have a poet to lead u in our endeavour be entirely appropriate .
again , because these conciliation be not entirely straight forward , we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skill in the convoluted field of ensure that cultural expenditure be wisely deploy and give to u in our Community .
the fundamental question , it seem to me , that face this Parliament , the Commission and the Council be : what be Europe ?
what do it mean and what do Europe give u over and above the parameter of our national boundary ?
Europe be it people , it history and now it collectivity ; but the reason why Culture 2000 be so important to u be for this : I will wager that when we ask the question - & apos ; What be Europe ? & apos ; - we answer it by say , & apos ; It be our art , it be our literature and it be our heritage . & apos ;
that be what Culture 2000 represent .
it represent the possibility of sustain a European identity in the twenty-first century , an identity which eschew the echo of division , of war , of poverty , of opportunity , of poverty dans la realité .
and more than this - and this be more prosaic , Madam President , it mean that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiative by put them into action in new programme that be comprehensive , that be cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industry to the extent that they now require .
it promote mobility , and it open the door of culture to the socially disadvantage and exclude .
my only regret be that in promote this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspiration and ensure our ability to deliver .
Madam President , lady and gentleman , we have now come to the end of a long road .
follow the conciliation stage , our institution can now formally adopt the new & apos ; Culture 2000 & apos ; framework programme .
we shall thus , in the course of the next five year , have a tool perfectly suit to develop clear , well-structured and , I be sure , successful measure in order to promote the cultural sector .
it be with great satisfaction that I today welcome this & apos ; happy end & apos ; in this House , and I thank you for it .
I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who work to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process .
I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , particularly to it rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , it chairman , Mr Gargani , the European Parliament delegation and the leader of the political group , the Conciliation Committee and it chairman , Mr Imbeni .
they all make a vital constructive and balanced contribution .
throughout the negotiation , they be of great help and it must be say that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiation be nonetheless complete in record time .
we now have a framework programme , the first of it type for the cultural sector , and this programme make it possible for u to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive , but also more thorough and detailed manner .
I would like to express my delight , with you , at this please outcome.In spite of a budget situation which do not match up to our ambition , these result will now enable u to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani have just say , that the Commission make a statement regard a mid-term assessment .
it state that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision , it would carry out an assessment of the result of the programme , and this assessment will also cover the financial resource in the context of the Community financial perspective .
if need be , the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision , and this should be achieve by 30 June 2002 .
lady and gentleman , this be a formal commitment , not just word on paper .
all this must lead u to intensify our action in favour of develop a common cultural area , within which our culture can flourish further in all their unique feature , in all their diversity , but may also be mutually enrich and the other citizen of Europe may participate fully in them .
it be thanks , too , to Parliament & apos ; s action , prefer a number of small-scale measure to be carry out close to the citizen & apos ; cultural root rather than vast measure on a spectacular scale .
this be go to lead u to make & apos ; Culture 2000 & apos ; the programme of the citizen .
the increased participation of our citizen be something I hope and pray for.I would like this participation to be a extensive and productive a possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five year cover by the programme it become a tangible reality .
I know that you , a Members of Parliament , in your own region and country , be all go to work together with the programme participant so that all these small flower , a one Member of Parliament say , go to make a vast multicoloured carpet .
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizen , both in personal a well a in social and economic term , but a right which it be our job to assert , and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union .
this be what our European & apos ; Culture 2000 & apos ; programme offer .
it do not compete with the cultural policy implement in the various Member States .
such policy be necessary , and I would like to see them develop further .
it simply add to them , complement them , build a bridge between the various culture of our various country .
I feel therefore that extend and enrich European citizen & apos ; participation in culture be a crucial task , one which justify the effort we make to achieve it , and this be the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union .
a number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raise this point.If the Union be purely an economic union , then it be a stillborn project .
however , if it be a union of culture , civilisation and participation , then it become a living thing .
this be the foundation , lady and gentleman , which I intend to develop , and I shall take the following five area into special consideration : firstly , provide creative people with opportunity of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserve in our programme .
secondly , encourage exchange , mobility and training in the cultural sector .
thirdly , promote cooperation between cultural operator .
fourthly , increase audience for culture , with particular emphasis on attract young people to culture and , fifthly , protect the common cultural heritage on the European scale a well a the history of the people of Europe , and make them better know .
the new programme will , I be sure , in term of it structure and organisation base on transparency , efficiency and balance , prove to be an instrument a successful a it be essential to our measure .
Madam President , I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for it support and for , once again , have show the importance it attach to culture in the context of the Union .
I be certain that it will not be disappoint , have give u it support , and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed , a thing progress , of the various phase of the implementation of our measure and the measure of our citizen , which I hope will be great measure for the future of the Union .
thank you , Commissioner .
I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
( the sitting be close at 9.55 p.m . )
end-of-life vehicle
Mr President , nine million car be shred and scrap every year in Europe .
even though they can no longer be drive , these nine million car may still be trade and move across border ; and not just intra-Community border , but also those outside the Union .
it be therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rule on how these nine million vehicle every year be to be recycle and process .
we believe that the directive have a few weakness that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which be genuinely ground-breaking .
we therefore have a number of amendment .
I personally believe that the scope of the directive go beyond it objective .
I do not think it be necessary for classic car to be part of the directive .
nor do I think that motorcycle should be include , a the distinctive culture of recycle within the motorcycle industry obviate the need for a European directive in this area .
I be not look for such rigidly high recycle quota when it come to special-purpose vehicle either .
I want special-purpose vehicle such a ambulance to have high recovery quota .
this be my main concern in this matter .
in my opinion , the directive solidly regulate the matter of accountability for how a car be dispose of in Europe .
this can be leave a the Commission have propose with the Member States ensure the appropriate collection point for drain car .
this will involve , for example , dispose of more than 32 million lot of used oil , remove break fluid , etc .
an important part of this directive be the issue of what to do with used part .
what should we do with the shredded product ?
we should not overlook the fact that , although quota be an important point in recycle and recovery , they be by no mean the only point .
do not forget that , in the case of car , 80 % of environmental impact come through driving , 1 % through recovery and 19 % through construction .
quota be not , therefore , the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility , just one of many .
of course we need to aim high , but quota must not become an end in themselves .
we must understand that the bigger picture be important when it come to the environmental impact of car .
I be far keener to see u move away from today & apos ; s car , weigh 1,400 kg and drive an average of 200,000 km , to a future car capable of drive the same distance but weigh just 1,000 kg .
this would at least mean 400 kg time 200,000 km le transportation .
this would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which , if I have rightly understand the Kyoto Protocol , be the important factor .
we therefore consider that , in future , vehicle which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction method will produce le CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quota .
it should not be for each Member State , but for you and your staff , Commissioner , to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicle ( and there be also talk of 3-litre vehicle ) should receive preferential treatment .
we think they should .
may I say something about cost .
some say that all the cost should be bear by the manufacturer ; that this be only right and in the very best interest of the consumer .
however , this can be seriously question a the manufacturer will pass on all the cost to consumer and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycle .
I can only warn you against consent to this .
there be amendment which propose split the cost fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car .
the money from this pool , system , or however you want to picture it , would mean that from 2006 all vehicle in circulation could be take in without cost to the last holder .
this too be a particular desire of my group .
our proposal to split the cost have a crucial advantage , namely that we win & apos ; t be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive be adopt .
the car industry be concern about and half expect repercussion , which be a serious problem which we must address accordingly .
this be why I propose split the cost between the first holder and the manufacturer .
a for a ban on certain material : of course we need one !
a car have dangerous component which we must ban long-term .
this mean that we need a pressure instrument .
the Commission have put forward various proposal which be too stringent and we have come up with some alternative .
there be a number of sound amendment .
this Parliament have be give more authority , so let u use it !
let u have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive .
a directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House .
I ask for your support .
Mr President , I almost feel like say , & quot ; Phew & quot ; , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which have give u so much work , and which have clearly also give a great deal of work to the rapporteur , Mr Florenz .
I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it do not answer the real question over what be go to be do with vehicle which have already be abandon and which , today , can only be remove at local authority expense , i.e . the taxpayer & apos ; expense .
the principle of & apos ; polluter pay & apos ; be not be apply .
vehicle already abandon have also be abandon by Community legislation , in that they be not take into consideration either in the text on emission or in this text on end-of-life vehicle .
the only merit of this directive be that it look to the future .
it have not , however , be possible to solve the problem of vehicle currently be use but which be already old and which cost far more to recycle .
on the other hand , we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the effort that car manufacturer be prepared to make in order to find ( a ) material that be easier to recycle and ( b ) to set up recycle industry .
I should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycle , reuse and incineration , a far a the new particularly light material be concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emission .
this be a problem of compatibility between our directive on end-of-life vehicle and the former directive , include the one on auto-oil , which we vote on a few year ago .
we must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on have the wisdom , in order to make thing perfectly clear , to reintroduce the clause make an exception of the vintage car which be part of our industrial and cultural heritage .
in conclusion , let me say that this directive be not ambitious enough to solve the problem of present car number and it be rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserve for the wreck which still clutter our forest , lake and garden .
once again , the principle of & apos ; polluter pay & apos ; be not be applied.The taxpayer be still foot the bill .
Mr President , Commissioner , read the leaflet which have be distribute in recent week , one would think that we be talk about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe .
neither be correct .
we simply must realise that the directive on the table be a sound directive .
it mean ecological progress for Europe , and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enact it and set it in motion .
all the same , there be one point on which we be in conflict .
in the grand scheme of the directive , it be perhaps a minor point , but nevertheless a disputed one .
it concern the issue of recycle cost .
here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year & apos ; s debate in the Council when freedom from cost for the last owner and the issue of financing be lump together and a question mark place over whether the last owner should really be free from cost .
last February in this House we unambiguously decide ( and we Social Democrats be stick to this ) that the matter of freedom from cost for the last owner be not open to question !
so who will pay for the vehicle which be to be dispose of ?
for u this be straightforward : in the case of new vehicle it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturer to design and build recyclable car .
and what about vehicle which be already on the road ?
let u look at an example.Rover in Great Britain , if they be responsible for all end-of-life car , would actually be responsible for 5.8 million car within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycle cost , whereas a manufacturer from Korea build similar car would only have to shell out peanut , a a representative of Deutsche Bank put it .
such distortion in competition be not about environmental protection ; they simply affect investment potential and the job of those building car in Europe .
consequently , for end-of-life vehicle we propose set up a fund to cover the cost of recycle end-of-life vehicle in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from cost .
I can understand it when colleague from country which do not build car advocate that manufacturer should pay the full whack and that they be not interested in the problem of distortion in competition when it come to set aside fund .
however , I would ask these colleague to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from build car in Europe , so that these job can be secure in the future .
I be in favour of stringent environmental requirement , a you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emission , but I believe that they should be the same for everyone !
Mr President , Commissioner , I think we need this directive .
firstly , because it clearly stipulate the environmental objective .
secondly , because it can promote recycling , which be important .
thirdly , because it set out a clear procedure to combat pollution cause by heavy metal .
this be also an important point .
the directive affords a European framework , also to Member States who already have system in place and who wish to continue to use these .
so , first of all , we need to keep the recycling percentage at their present level.This will , of course , provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identify way of deal with material that we do not a yet know how to dispose of .
secondly , we need to retain the detail a they be include in the common position .
a from 2006 , therefore , all vehicle should be hand in at no cost to their last owner .
needle to say , this be most definitely an essential point which should not be change in any way .
be this too much of a burden ?
there be , however , one thing we should not overlook .
the directive applies to complete car , that be to say car with none of the essential component miss .
accord to the expert , few of these complete car be of no value .
after all , recycle and the re-use of component form part of a sector which be not necessarily loss-making .
quite the reverse , in fact.At present , there be a whole raft of company which make a live out of them , and a decent one at that .
this directive encourage the whole of this sector .
it be a sector which comprise small and medium-sized business .
since , in this case , transport cost be high , a system will have to be introduce which will need to be very much decentralise , because transport an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km be not a profitable activity .
I think it be a good thing that this directive do not need to apply to historic vehicle , and I think we ought to add this provision to it .
I think , therefore , that vintage car ought to be exempt .
also , it be a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer .
that be a basic principle which we must uphold .
a manufacturer be responsible for the design , they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase .
we must also insist that the cost be borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer , a stipulate in the common position .
I find this a well-balanced formula which do not preclude a number of other thing .
I think we need to retain it .
this be why our group will remain a close to the common position a possible and will not alter it essence .
after all , we be all aware how difficult it be within the Council to bring this common position about , and that it be a very difficult balance act to reach this common position .
in my opinion , we should not jeopardise that common position , because it be a directive which we desperately need for environmental reason .
I would ask you to support this common position .
our group will , at any rate , do this a far a possible - for environmental reason and because we have this directive which be well-balanced and encompass a whole range of issue and difficulty include , for example , the way in which the cost be to be distribute .
Mr President , we need to take an important decision today .
do this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer & apos ; s liability , that be to say that car , once they have reach the end of their life , be the responsibility of the car manufacturer ?
no , accord to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No . 38 : car manufacturer and car driver should split the cost 50 / 50 .
it be evident from the packaging directive in which this 50 / 50 compromise be include that this do not work .
packaging still account for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and be a burden upon the environment .
some of the socialist under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say : yes , we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 accord to Amendment No 45 .
the common position stipulates 2006 .
accord to the group of the Greens , this give the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparation .
I would therefore urge my colleague not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialist .
if car manufacturer need to bear the cost of recycle their car , they will design these car in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply .
the problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in car and these product will be replace by plant-based bioplastic .
this be ultimately cheaper , also for the consumer .
for twenty year , the majority within Parliament have attempt to make European environmental policy greener .
today , this green position be be threaten under pressure from , in particular , the German and French car industry .
that be why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45 .
we , the Green Group , by and large support the common position .
Mr President , the waste from end-of-life vehicle be one of our really major environmental problem in term both of the quantity of waste and of emission of environmentally hazardous substance .
we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left therefore want a comprehensive and consistent a set of regulation a be humanly possible in this area .
with this directive , we have the chance to take a big step forward , but this presuppose that the Council & apos ; s position be not tear to shred and weaken in Parliament & apos ; s reading of it .
if they be adopt , many of the amendment which have be table would considerably weaken the directive .
this apply , above all , to amendment from the Group of the European People & apos ; s Party but also , unfortunately , to some of the amendment from Mr Lange , a I see it .
it be easy to see that the car industry in certain country , for example in Germany , go in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive be adopt .
for ourselves , it be crucial that the following principle should apply .
the polluter should pay .
this mean that it be the manufacturer which should take full responsibility , financial a well a otherwise , for recycle vehicle .
there must be rule govern exist vehicle too .
where this aspect be concern , we can not accept any weakening of the Council & apos ; s position regard the date from which the regulation be to come into force .
there should be no falling-off in the percentage concern or in the requirement for recycle vehicle from particular year , and it be important to limit the use of dangerous substance such a lead .
we shall vote against any amendment which run counter to these consideration .
if those amendment be adopt which would considerably weaken the directive , this would be very detrimental , not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament & apos ; s credibility on environmental issue .
reference be make earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be give to the million of people who work in the car industry in various country and to those country which have large car industry , for example my own country , Sweden .
I be myself a car worker before I be elect .
I believe I be one of the few member of this Parliament to have stand beside a production line and assembled car .
I think that very tough demand should be make of the car industry .
these would , of course , be to the advantage of modern , progressive car manufacturer who think in environmentally friendly term .
it be precisely this type of car industry which we should be encourage in the European Union .
Mr President , I be very pleased that environmental protection be now a priority for this Parliament , a indeed it be for the citizen of Europe .
there be no doubt that abandon car represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment .
our citizen expect u in this regard to protect their interest .
each year , there be between 8 and 9 million vehicle scrap within the European Union.This in itself generate a large amount of waste .
car manufacturer , the supplier of material and equipment manufacturer must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substance and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycle material can be use in the manufacture of car .
we know that in the Netherlands there be authorised treatment centre in place to collect end-of-life vehicle and this process should be extend across the length and breadth of the European Union .
from an Irish perspective , I know that the Irish Department of the Environment be already have consultation with motor industry representative to ensure that appropriate collection centre be put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicle .
I see no reason why licensing arrangement can not be organise across Europe for collection centre to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicle which be dispose of within the European Union on an annual basis .
car manufacturer will have to provide information on the rate of re-use , recycle and recovery of used car which will be achieve in the come year .
in accordance with new provision include in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 370 million consumer within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information .
I believe EU consumer will support those car manufacturer that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practice in the coming year .
my final point be that the regulation and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of it role in relation to the social sector and it environmental and economic consideration .
Mr President , the directive on end-of-life vehicle be certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe .
I also think that a great effort have be make to arrive at intelligent recycling of material , a reduction of pollute waste and the promotion of technological innovation .
in this regard , we be certainly on the right track , but a some Members have already stress , the real issue here be the possibility that manufacturer & apos ; responsibility will become a shared responsibility .
I would like to say that in Italy , considerable headway have be make in this sector ; we be perhaps the first in Europe to have regulation encourage u to take end-of-life vehicle off the market , but in our country the average age of car on the road be rather high , and we therefore have serious concern over the problem that this directive could entail for the market .
we need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter .
in Italy , we have begin to withdraw and recycle around 80 % of old car , but there be a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in term of unemployment give that in Italy industry often resort to lay-offs and redundancy - and cause problem for worker in different part of Italy .
we must therefore try to reconcile the two requirement - Parliament be sometimes a little extremist , adopt position that be either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green - and , all thing consider , find a way to combine the effort make by Mr Florenz and that of other Members , who be try to reconcile the two position a best a possible .
these worthwhile amendment be the outcome of this ;
I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem , that be , to reconcile environmental requirement with market and labour requirement .
Mr President , this directive deal with the comparatively small but grow problem of abandoned car and the question of a more structured disposal of all car at the end of their life .
to that extent , it might be think desirable , even if it be not a matter of urgent necessity .
the key question now be who pay the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million car that be dispose of each year ?
who pay for the collection , the dismantling , the disposal and so on ?
and should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that have ever be make ?
the proposal from the Council , the common position , be that manufacturer should pay the lot .
that would mean billion of pound or euro for each of the major company in each of the country of the European Union .
that cost would inevitably be pass on to the price and hence to the buyer of new car .
because European car manufacture have be operate here for many , many more decade than company from Japan , Korea and elsewhere , that would be a much greater burden on the older European company and a competitive gift to their competitor from elsewhere .
I commend Mr Florenz , Mr Lange and others who have seek from both side of the party divide a compromise base on shared cost .
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleague from Germany , Italy , Ireland , Spain , Sweden and Britain , to remove the retrospective nature of this measure .
retrospective law be bad law , it be unfair law and often it be unworkable law .
most democratic parliament in the free world reject it on principle unless there be overwhelming public interest , which clearly there be not in this case .
that be why I have call for a roll-call vote on this .
we can see who be prepare to vote for a retrospection which be of doubtful legality , which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry .
Mr President , once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issue involve in this directive , and reaffirm my support for the amendment table by my colleague , Bernd Lange .
these amendment actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconcile environmental constraint and economic imperative .
the Council & apos ; s common position be to say that car manufacturer should bear all , or a significant part , of the cost of recovery and recycling .
but , a Mr Lange so rightly say , this solution be totally unfair to European car manufacturer .
come from a country which do have a car manufacturing industry , I can tell you that it be not possible , retroactively , to impose on them the total financial cost for all vehicle of their make currently on the road , i.e . effectively make them bear the cost arise from 80 % of the total number of car in Europe .
this solution be unacceptable because these car manufacturer have not have the opportunity to build the environmental demand we be make of them today into their manufacturing procedure and their manufacturing cost .
the common position put European car manufacturer in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturer which have just come to the European market .
of course , we be not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby.We be here to build a Europe that be competitive on the world market and to safeguard job in economic sector where we be actually competitive .
Mr President , Commissioner , the propose directive on end-of-life vehicle before u today aim firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union , but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector .
let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicle must , of course , be exempt from the scope of this directive .
car be also part of our cultural heritage.I think we would all agree on that .
have say that , one of the stumble block concern Article 12 , i.e . the date on which the directive will come into force .
Parliament & apos ; s propose solution of 18 month follow the directive & apos ; s entry into force , for new vehicle , be not terribly realistic .
the European car population amount to several ten of million of car which will have to be recover even though they be not design for recycle .
the common position be more feasible since it envisage 2006 for vehicle already on the road .
this would , furthermore , make it possible to allow firm time to make fund available to meet these additional expense .
like my group , I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which , I feel , offer a balanced compromise between constraint upon firm and essential advance in environmental protection .
Mr President , the European Parliament be today face an important decision .
will we give our back to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or , a the amendment of Florenz , Lange and others cause me to fear , will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry ?
the credibility of Parliament a a champion of environmental protection be at stake .
it would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament be to draw back from the profession the government of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have be make concern manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection !
the intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendment be obvious : to sabotage the directive !
the propose share responsibility would undermine the polluter pay principle and detract from product innovation .
in set up numerous hurdle their sole aim be to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by go down the road of type approval they seek to delay the implementation of the directive by 12 year or more .
this be totally unacceptable .
I therefore appeal to the German delegate in particular to prevent major political damage occur today !
the red-green federal government have not exactly cover itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive .
do not continue in this vein !
the whinging about competitive disadvantage be laughable if it only concern competitive disadvantage sustain by the German car industry .
start represent your people and not just your car manufacturer !
vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycle industry !
Mr President , this directive have be under discussion since 1997 .
it be high time that we reach an agreement .
since I more or le share the view of my colleague , Mr Sjöstedt and the representative of the Greens , Mr de Roo , I be not go to use the two minute allot to me , and I will highlight just two issue .
firstly , and this be perhaps the basic point of the proposal , the idea , which go hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste , that we should use material which will subsequently cause le pollution .
another point be that waste should not be incinerate or crush , not only in the case of lead , cadmium and mercury , but also in the case of waste which contain PVC .
Parliament be currently discuss this issue in another context .
the other question be who should bear the cost .
I agree with previous speaker who have say that the polluter should pay , and this proposal express that idea very well .
producer must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequence of this - and they must take responsibility for the cost before 2006 , a some of the amendment propose .
we be more in agreement with the amendment propose at first reading .
it be also important to set percentage and a date for vehicle to be compose of recyclable material .
I believe that this proposal rely on very long deadline .
lastly , Mr President , I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized business which , if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorise , can promote the creation of job in this very important area , prevent the emergence of monopoly by large company .
Mr President , today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibility .
we have to work out what we be go to do with the million of vehicle we abandon each year .
in some of our Member States , voluntary environmental agreement have already be sign to ensure that our ditch , canal and field be not fill with these ugly and dangerous wreck , inhabit occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken .
I come , of course , from a country that be proud of it car industry and of it commercial success both in Europe and in third country .
I can gauge it importance for my country & apos ; s international reputation .
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which have set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantle end-of-life vehicle .
I be aware of the difficulty the Council experience in find a compromise .
that be why , today , we must be understanding alchemist , concern for our environment .
this will either be the century of waste management or it will not .
a far a I be concerned , at least , the principle of & apos ; polluter pay & apos ; must be apply .
the car industry , increasingly more respectful of the environment , have , I be sure , anticipate this kind of increase awareness .
indeed it be accept it responsibility .
it be the Member States , however , who will have to implement this directive , and let u beware of go into too much detail because the industrial tradition , the demolition and crush sector vary accord to whether you be in Italy or in Finland .
I be opposed to make the car owner liable .
the men and woman on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter , pay their national tax and the tax on fuel and be therefore already pay a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement .
it would certainly be unwise for my fellow Members in the major group of the federalist tendency to seek to make the European Parliament unpopular in this way by create a liability share between the owner and the manufacturer .
how , furthermore , can a fund be create which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operation within Europe .
who be to pay for recycle the car I buy in France if I register it in Belgium ?
which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle ?
let u beware , too , of worry the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application .
it be not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today , but to continue on our present course , advocate sustainable development .
Mr President , most of the time , the European Parliament , spearhead by environment committee , do it very best to make a critical assessment of the proposal submit by the European Commission or the Council , so a to improve on them from an environmental point of view .
now , a sound common position submit by the Council be in danger of be change for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament .
every year , we discard a huge amount of car which contain many dangerous substance .
this be why it be important to prevent waste material .
we should also aim for minimum quantity of heavy metal , a well a of other dangerous substance and material .
in addition , car manufacturer need to produce and build these car in such a way a to facilitate simple dismantling and re-use .
what be leave of the stripped vehicle also require to be process adequately .
I therefore welcome with open arm the percentage level for re-use and recycle which have be propose by the Council .
these day , the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicle be economically viable .
this mean that we move away from shred .
the prescribed objective be most certainly viable and , in the Netherlands , a value of 86 % recycling have now already be achieve .
the best way of achieve proper collection be to ensure that the last holder and / or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost .
the processing cost can then be incorporate in the price of new car .
the proposal make by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system .
the so-called share liability be very cumbersome and do not stimulate innovation .
if the system of deliver car to treatment facility without any cost be apply , it will also transpire that the cost of process will come down considerably .
finally , this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity .
a laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay , at the expense of the environment .
why can not we just be satisfy with the common position currently table ? if we be , then all that remain for u to do be to congratulate the Council on the result achieve .
Mr President , I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem .
he have deliver excellent work under pressure both from his colleague and from the car industry .
add to this the fact that he have to do this from his green approach and , against that background , find a compromise.That be not easy .
overall , I be not dissatisfy with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlie that common position.I would like to comment on two thing .
firstly , vintage car and motorbike .
these should indeed be exclude from the directive.Secondly , the controversial question a to who bear the responsibility for take back car .
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way .
the manufacturer be and should be liable and the last holder and / or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost .
in my opinion , there be too much initial hesitation .
the car lobby have lead too many people up the garden path .
I would also like to mention that experience have nonetheless teach u that the processing cost be in fact pass on .
these cost be not very high .
in the Member State where I come from , you be talk about 150 Guilders per car .
if you charge this from day one , you can process the old car straight away .
a very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards , which use to be a common feature in our Member States , would then disappear .
I do not wish to make any change to this particular aspect of the compromise .
I think it would be a good thing if we be to approve the present legislation together a soon a possible .
this be positive because , in that way , the nine million car which be introduce each year onto European road will actually be process appropriately , and this will benefit u all .
Mr President , the present directive be important in so far a it help prevent our be face with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicle and in so far a it promote the re-use and recycling of material from scrapped car .
I therefore think it be crucial for the environment that the ban on use poisonous heavy metal should be fully implement and that we should not reduce manufacturer & apos ; liability .
if we do reduce it , we remove from manufacturer the incentive to design and produce car which give rise to le waste .
if these amendment be adopt , I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issue .
so far , we here in Parliament have be positive catalyst for environmental protection but now , if the amendment propose by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange be adopt , we be to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe .
what be more , if we reduce manufacturer & apos ; liability on this issue , this will also have serious consequence for subsequent matter in other area , for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computer and other electronic equipment .
I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party line and vote against all the amendment to the common position which would weaken environmental standard and reduce manufacturer & apos ; liability .
we shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result .
Mr President , this excellent directive will end the dumping of old car , encourage recycling , and above all encourage manufacturer to design car which can easily be recycle .
now who should pay the cost ?
whatever system be adopt , ultimately the cost will be pass on to the consumer .
the best way of achieve our environmental objective be to make the manufacturer our instrument both for collect the money and for dispose and recycle of the car .
the manufacturer have trick Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into table amendment here which seriously weaken these proposal .
do not be fool by the car manufacturer !
if you want the full benefit of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendment .
Mr President , Commissioner , this debate be not a technical debate , contrary to what we may think .
it have become eminently political .
yesterday we honour our institution with a political debate .
today , if 314 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturer , we should be do ourselves dishonour .
we can not accept this .
it would be a precedent which would open the door to all sort of pressure in many other area .
it would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weaken a Council position , whereas usually we be complain that their position be not strong enough .
the free recovery system , for example , for old vehicle and raise the percentage to be recycle will increase recycle activity and the number of job this generate accordingly .
thus , for the consumer , for the environment and for the new job to be create in recycle , the Council & apos ; s common position definitely must not be amended.It be , a it stand , perfectly acceptable .
Mr President , like so many others here today , I believe this be a good measure .
this be a useful measure and it be one which we all need .
most of the technical issue have be resolve .
there be some detail to be finalise but most of the technical issue have be resolve .
we have arrive at the final question .
in the first reading debate it be only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which ask this question and it be only myself a the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who pose that question in Parliament.That be quite simply : who pay ?
the Council common position reach a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturer should pay a significant part of the cost , not all of it a Mr Bowis have mistakenly say .
in fact perhaps a little , the lawyer tell u , a 20 % or one-fifth of the cost.That be not unreasonable .
if you look at the UK consumer for example , who buy a Rover , a Mr Lange have indicate or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who have for year be pay excessive price for those car , over and above comparable price in other part of Europe , why should they pay ?
they have pay already .
why should the very same people a taxpayer or a future car buyer , pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer have make the profit from ?
I can not accept that .
there be amendment here today that be propose that should be the case .
I can not accept it and I will not vote for it .
the responsibility for these car lie with the manufacturer .
it be the manufacturer who have to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal .
the common position do not preclude the possibility of contribution be make by government .
the common position be a reasonable compromise .
some of the amendment today be totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of pay a little if any of the cost of disposal of car on the road .
I can not accept that and on behalf of the taxpayer and the consumer of Europe I be vote against those amendment .
Mr President , there be agreement that we must give some thought a to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life car , although in this instance the Council have not provide a model for a suitable European environment policy .
it be disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handle this matter .
firstly , Herr Trittin , the Environment Minister , be not in tune with his colleague in the Cabinet , then Chancellor Schröder blunder in like a bull in a china shop , have no expert knowledge of this process .
mind you , even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June be not the best result that could have be do achieve .
there be certain weakness , the greatest of which , in my opinion , be that not enough consideration be be give to the situation of small business ; after all , the car industry be more than just large company .
it be in the area of supply that small business play an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interest of those employ in small and medium-sized enterprise .
for there be considerably more than two million people employ in this sector .
the plight of small business be also address by numerous amendment from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendment in question from our group to Article 5 concerning cost .
the common position be also no great shake from an environmental viewpoint .
consequently , we must support an amendment which at least permit exception in the case of particularly economical car .
the objection of the industry in this matter be certainly not without foundation .
however , the argument of the plastic and car industry would be more persuasive if a commitment be to be give to reduce CO2 level in Europe in other sector besides these .
Mr President , we be indeed now in a very rare situation : those who wish to uphold environmental value will take the side of the Council in their common position .
in contrast to what the previous speaker say , I can say I be really proud that a common position be achieve during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental value .
if we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling cost , we will be create a loophole : we will not have create a rational , clear system in which the division of responsibility be in order .
that be why , in my opinion , the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility .
only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem , take into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encourage to make vehicle whose part can be recycle at the smallest possible cost in the future .
Mr President , there be two issue of principle in the Council & apos ; s draft directive .
the first concern the manufacturer & apos ; s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicle .
there be the risk of create a monopoly within the car dismantle trade .
this particularly apply in area within the EU where distance be great and where a lot of small company be involve in dismantle vehicle .
I believe that , quite apart from the nature of the issue concern , the EU & apos ; s directive should not treat small company within the Union unfairly .
unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturer would also be in danger of create a situation in which the market for used car part disappears , for manufacturer would have a greater responsibility to sell new part .
yet the trade in used car part be important , especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicle .
the principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturer be also dubious in term of the principle govern the market economy .
it should be possible for change to be make to company and for the latter to be sell and wind up .
they should be able to establish themselves in new market , but also to leave old market .
to bind manufacturer by mean of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accord with a flexible market economy design to promote development .
the second principle in the Council & apos ; s common position be the retroactive element in the draft directive .
it conflict with establish economic and legal principle retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for it product .
to do so also change the owner & apos ; s liability retroactively .
over the year , a consumer may have alter the product in a number of way .
every country within the EU now have rule govern the scrapping of car .
some may be better than others , and some worse .
in anticipation of this EU directive & apos ; s be implement , EU country ought however to be individually liable for scrap vehicle in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation be not apply .
this do not conflict with a financing model involve the building up of fund .
Mr President , everyone agree with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question .
the common position offer an acceptable compromise but it rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restrict the opportunity for improvement , and put the whole directive at risk .
I therefore maintain that Parliament can not force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefine the environmental scope of the instrument .
I would remind you that car manufacturer have admit that they can live with the directive ; the cost be not excessive : recycle a car cost le than 1 % of the price of a new car .
moreover , the manufacturer will not be financially accountable until 2006 , when a good number of the exist vehicle will no longer be on the market .
a for the remain vehicle , we could nevertheless provide for some mean of share cost , a be propose in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 by Mr Lange , the only one that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trial underway in some country , and we should therefore support them .
Mr President , this be an extremely bad directive .
first of all , a my colleague Mr Bowis have point out , it be retrospective and that be wrong in principle .
secondly , it dump huge cost on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment .
in this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and job in Europe and yet we constantly pas measure which will have the effect of reduce employment .
I suggest to you that the directive be bad in another respect , which have not be examine well enough in this debate.It be like so much European legislation .
it be far too prescriptive .
it set in stone one particular model of recycle .
the production line be invent about a hundred year ago , I believe , by Henry Ford and what we be propose to do here be to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicle , to take the piece apart and seek to recycle them .
one thing we should stop and think about be the fact that there be a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumper of car .
the plastic industry for the most part do not want to take these thing back and can not economically do so .
there be already a very successful industry out there which be shred car , recover metal and recover energy by the incineration of the non-metallic part .
this be a very environmentally reasonable approach .
it be just a good environmentally to burn old plastic a to burn new oil for energy recovery .
this method of disposal of car carry no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pay because the & quot ; dead & quot ; car would actually have a small value go into the recycling and reclamation process .
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it be too prescriptive , it ignore what be actually go on in the car recycle market at the moment and it set in stone method which be not necessarily the best environmentally , and be certainly very damaging economically .
Mr President , the common position be sound , but it be up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicle .
the Social-Democratic Group have submit a few important proposal for improvement over the past couple of day .
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 45 , in which a choice be make in favour of lay the cost of disassembly and recycle at the door of the manufacturer , for new car at any rate .
consequently , consideration will also be give to recycle during the conception phase and production .
for the car currently on the road , it would be reasonable to share the cost , for example by set up a fund such a that in the Netherlands .
the common position stipulates that manufacturer should not only bear the cost , they should also take back end-of-life vehicle .
this be a big problem in my opinion .
I urge that car manufacturer should most definitely not be give the task of organise the dismantling and recycling of vehicle , a they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand component market .
they would then determine their own price .
anyone who have be in an old car know that this be to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic .
the European consumer organisation , which have ask u to support the common position on this point , be to my mind let the consumer down .
a second argument for keep the dismantling of car out of the manufacturer & apos ; clutch be the cost of transport .
if car manufacturer all set up their own dismantling company , this will necessitate transport end-of-life vehicle over long distance .
this be environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and do not benefit the consumer either .
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45 .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have ask to speak again so that I can say a few more word at the close of this debate .
if you travel to the Netherlands , you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free .
you will also find that these car be suitably dispose of , that new material flow have be open up in order to recycle material , that 85 % of the weight of a car be recycle and that 92 % of all car in the Netherlands be recycle .
this be finance by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes .
should this be condemn ecologically , Frau Breyer ?
I do not think so .
the Netherlands have an exemplary model for dispose of car a per the wish of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or , in the case of end-of-life vehicle currently drive around , the manufacturer , have nothing , absolutely nothing , to do with ecology ; it be a simple question of competition !
the issue here be whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR 250 million or a Korean manufacturer , say , EUR 2 million .
in term of the people who build car here in Europe , I be in favour of not make competition unequal but , in term of environmental protection , I want freedom from cost for the last owner , to be finance by a special fund , and manufacturer responsibility for new car , which will force them to assume responsibility for build recyclable car !
( applause from the PSE Group )
Mr President , the proposal we be discuss have a huge amount of advantage , mainly in the interest of prevent waste and encouraging re-use , the recovery and recycling of component and the recovery of material , etc.I think we have table a sound proposal .
the main thread of the discussion be about whether or not the manufacturer , the vendor , or whoever , should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost .
I will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system function there without any problem .
we have reach an agreement with all the party involve .
these include car manufacturer , second-hand car dealer , the federation of the car industry , the metal processing firm , shred firm and the government .
an environmental policy agreement have be sign on a voluntary basis .
the car industry - and Belgium produce a great many cars- do not have any problem with that .
Belgians can deliver their car back to the vendor without any cost .
in connection with this , we have notice how - quite contrary to what have be say here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small business have take the recycling of material to heart and be do very well .
some business have become hi-tech business , because they manage to recycle certain material , even material which be not yet include in the directive .
so this mean that we be develop a new sector and new employment and do the environment a huge favour into the bargain .
I be in favour of collection free of charge .
it work for u .
why would it not work elsewhere ?
Mr President , lady and gentleman , thank you for an interesting debate in which many important argument have be present .
would you be so kind a to bear with me for a few minute .
allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumption and principle behind the present directive .
allow me also to begin by comment on and respond to a couple of the most important argument in this debate .
first of all , I think I should repeat some of the basic fact which Mr Florenz and others have already mention .
what we be discuss here be the fact that close on ten million car be scrap every year in the European Union , result in approximately a many million of ton of waste .
this mean that almost ten million ton of waste be create by these car , and approximately seven per cent of the latter be abandon out in the open .
moreover , they constitute environmentally hazardous substance of the worst kind .
approximately ten per cent of lead production be to be find in car , but also cadmium , chromium , mercury and other very dangerous substance .
this be something you already know , but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who be listen .
car be one of the fastest grow source of waste we have in Europe .
we know that waste from car exists and we know how we ought to be deal with it , and there be no excuse for not take action .
the present directive have three aims.First of all , we want to stop heavy metal from be use in the manufacture of new car .
secondly , we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer be liable .
we can no longer take care of these matter at the end of a product & apos ; s life-cycle.Instead , we should avoid create so much waste .
we should see to it that we recycle a much a possible of the various content of a product .
thirdly , we wish to achieve the recycle objective specify in the present directive .
these be the three most important aim of the directive .
this be , of course , because it be a waste of resource for u not to ensure that material in car be recycle .
it be , above all , the manufacturer & apos ; s resource we be waste if we do not get to grip with a car & apos ; s life-cycle .
two important question have arise in this regard.Yes , there be in fact more than two question , but I want to mention just two of the most important .
first of all : who should pay ?
and secondly : be we reduce the European car industry & apos ; s competitiveness by mean of the present proposal ?
the first question , then , be about who should pay .
the directive state that the polluter should pay and that the cost be to be bear mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principle to be find in the EU & apos ; s treaty concern the manufacturer & apos ; s liability .
it be nonetheless clear that the cost will be bear jointly by manufacturer and consumer .
we have calculate that the cost of recycle car do not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car .
do we imagine , then , that the cost would disappear if we be not to adopt this directive ?
No.Clearly , we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment , but it will be very much greater .
moreover , the cost will have to be bear in the future .
the cost will not therefore disappear , but now we be clarify whose liability it be and how the cost be to be distribute .
be we therefore talk about a car industry in crisis ?
be it an unprofitable industry which we be discuss and which we really have to help by not impose more tax upon it ?
be it the case that the car industry definitely can not afford these ?
be it the case that the motif behind the propose measure be in actual fact concern with reduce the competitiveness of the European car industry ?
no , of course not .
it be quite the opposite .
do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly car and more fuel-efficient car be go to decline in the future ?
what kind of requirement do you think our child and grandchild and future legislator be go to make of car ?
naturally , that they should be environmentally friendly , that they should be recyclable , that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment .
it be , of course , only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry .
we must create form of motive power which be not damage to health and which be of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste , recycle material and compete by mean of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient car .
the fact that we have a European car industry which have already make great stride more than properly compensates for the fact that there be , in fact , a good many car on European road for which they must take responsibility .
the cost be not insurmountable ; nor be the task an impossible one .
if we develop motive power of the kind I have describe , I be quite certain that market force and commercial interest in the car industry will ensure that mechanism develop for deal with both the cost and the workload .
these will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycle system .
the industry itself will ensure that these system be introduce in Europe .
they will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry .
they will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually produce environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient car .
we must do this for the sake of the environment .
the cost will not disappear.Nor will the waste disappear .
but , otherwise , we must all of u , a taxpayer or citizen , foot the bill.What be more , the cost will be higher the longer we wait before take action .
that be what I should like to say by way of introduction .
I also want to comment on the question a to whether there be to be any retroactive legislation .
if we assume that , on average , a car have a life of eleven year , do Members , indeed do anyone , believe that we should wait for eleven year before we get to grip with this problem ?
do you think that , when we legislate about chemical , we should say that we be ignore those chemical which be already on the market and that we be legislate only for what be to be produce in the future ?
clearly , we must consider the problem which exist here and now and the challenge present by the exist range of car .
it be still not an insurmountable problem .
we can deal with it .
we already have an infrastructure .
we have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life car .
I naturally hope that the result of today & apos ; s vote will be a good one .
if I have not already do so , I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he have put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
in fact , it be in many respect pioneer work when it come to re-use and manufacturer & apos ; s liability .
I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effect on the environment .
we can not continue to close our eye to these matter .
a I have say , we have both the knowledge and the resource to cope with these issue .
after the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999 , the Commission & apos ; s proposal end up in an awkward political situation in the Council .
however , we obtain a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency .
now , we must ensure that the present legislative process be conclude successfully .
a total of 48 amendment have be table .
the Commission can adopt 10 amendment in their entirety .
three amendment can be partially approve , and one can be approve in principle .
certain amendment concern improvement to the Commission & apos ; s proposal which we adopt a early a at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such part of the original proposal a the Council have remove .
this apply to Amendment No 5 , exclude section 1 ; 8 and 9 , section 1 ; 10 and 12 , section 3 ; 15 , 16 , 20 , 22 , 24 and 25 .
these amendment can all be approve .
amendment Nos 6 and 21 be new ; the Commission can approve these .
the Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial change .
I want to emphasise that a number of the other amendment affect the proposal & apos ; s basic component involve a considerable watering-down of the level of environmental protection aim at by the common position .
they can not therefore be approve .
Parliament have traditionally make a major contribution to strengthen environmental legislation in Europe .
it would amaze and depress me if it be not to do so today .
I be very concerned about certain amendment from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillar of the present proposal into question .
these concern , for example , the phasing-out of heavy metal , manufacturer & apos ; s liability and the requirement for recycle .
I want to deal with these amendment on a group-by-group basis .
amendment Nos 4 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 28 , 30 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 concern the phasing-out of heavy metal .
amendment No 12 involve a delay of at least ten year in bring the provision into force .
amendment Nos 13 , 28 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 involve introduce unnecessary condition and exception .
this would mean that the process of replace dangerous substance would be implement more slowly .
amendment Nos 4 , 11 and 30 mean that heavy metal have to be separate from the waste before recycle .
the Commission considers that the type of phasing-out propose in the common position be easier to apply from a technical point of view .
amendment Nos 17 , 18 , 27 , 34 , 36 , 38 , 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer & apos ; s liability .
the compromise reach by the Council be fair but fragile .
the Commission do not consider that the amendment would improve the balance without , at the same time , create tension .
I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal document from the Commission be wrongly use , so create uncertainty about the Commission & apos ; s attitude to the issue .
I want to emphasise that , a early a 1997 , the Commission propose a special clause concern manufacturer & apos ; s liability and that the Commission entirely support the common position .
this do not impose disproportionate cost upon manufacturers.Far from it .
amendment Nos 39 , 40 , 46 and 47 concern quantify objective .
the high level of protection aim at by the common position would be very much undermine if the recycle objective for the year 2006 be remove .
these amendment would also make the objective awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise .
allow me also - listen carefully to what I be say now , because I have hear this reiterate in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and & quot ; cherish & quot ; car a mention in Amendments Nos 3 , 7 , and 9 , section 2 , and 35 .
such vehicle be not cover by the definition of waste and be not therefore include under the directive .
so , whatever have be state in this regard , vintage car and motorcycle be not include under the directive .
we do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive .
amendment No 23 involve the Commission & apos ; s have to adopt quality standard for reusable component .
this be not cover by the directive .
an ad hoc directive should therefore be demand from the European Parliament and the Council .
amendment Nos 29 , 31 and 41 water down the requirement concern the dismantling of vehicle .
there be a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reduce the chance of recycle plastic , tyre and glass .
finally , the Commission can not approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reason to do with legal clarity ; nor Amendment No 19 , which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage .
furthermore , Amendment No 43 do not fall within the directive & apos ; s area of applicability .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the debate be close .
we shall now proceed to the vote .

Madam President , a you know , the reason we be vote this report today rather than last week be because of the numerous and serious translation error , particularly in the French version .
you have receive a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistake in this report and in other report with which I have have dealing recently .
there be an error which have still not be correct and that be on Amendment No 4 .
in the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisation .
in the French version that become & apos ; entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisation scientifiques & apos ; .
could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises be not correct .
it should not be in the amendment .
and , again , I urge you , Madam President , to look at the standard of translation that we be receive currently .
Madame McNally , in general , I be myself rather concern at the increase number of problem we be have with the translation .
I shall consult the parliamentary service to see how we can find a solution .

explanation OF VOTE
McNally Report ( A5-0082 / 1999 )
- ( FR ) I be pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission entitle & apos ; Women and Science & apos ; .
in this document , the Commission propose to stimulate debate with a view to promote the increase participation of woman in research in Europe .
this objective deserve our total support .
expenditure on research and technology actually form a sizeable part of the budget of the European Union , after agriculture and the Structural Funds .
the various framework programme have enable not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researcher in various Member States .
relatively few woman , however , be active in scientific discipline despite the excellent result they achieve in their study .
it be unacceptable for woman to continue to be underrepresented .
I be therefore delighted to see the proposal of the European Commission .
the Commission document set out to focus on the initiative to be take at Community level , especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development , which be quite obviously something I approve of .
the goal for the year to come be to increase woman & apos ; s participation to achieve a rate of 40 % female participation in the Marie Curie grant , in consultative assembly and in evaluation panel for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development .
furthermore , like the rapporteur , I think that study must be undertake to analyse the reason for the gap between the number of woman with science degree and the number of woman who manage to have a career in these field .
improve analysis of the obstacle face woman will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacle .
we will have to enlist the support of the many exist network of woman scientist and to obtain their assistance in frame a joint research policy .
the European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development a regard the promotion of woman and to come up with idea for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development .
we must incorporate the gender factor in science , research and all other European Union policy , in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevent woman compete on equal term in the labour market .
in it communication & quot ; Women and Science & quot ; , the European Commission informs u of it good intention of enlist the support of woman to enrich research in Europe .
this be very good , and we be pleased to see it .
the fact be there be too few woman involve in research work in the European Union .
we know that we can change this situation , in which woman be underrepresented in the science sector , only by mean of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choice for girl and , when they have obtain their degree , by mean of positive measure at the professional level .
have say this , some of our fellow Members clearly have qualm because the report by the Committee on Women & apos ; s Rights and Equal Opportunities which we have vote on contains one point which may lead to confusion and be interpret by some a a quota stipulate that there must be 40 % female participating in research in Europe .
this be patently not the case , since such a quota would not be realistic .
indeed the report do not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieve .
to set my fellow Members & apos ; mind at ease and to reassure them , I have table an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission , in it communication , undertakes to make significant effort to increase woman & apos ; s participation in Community research programme , which be , after all , a praiseworthy goal .
and why should we not note that the Commission & apos ; s communication stipulates specifically that it consider a 40 % minimum level to be a crucial goal for woman & apos ; s participation at all level in the implementation and management of research programme ?
it be not a quota !
it be a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission , insofar a it concern it own programme and not those of Member States .
the latter would be well advise , however , to follow the good example of the Commission , for once , and make the same effort in their own research programme .
people must realise this !
I be pleased to see that the debate on Mrs McNally & apos ; s report with a view to increase and facilitate woman & apos ; s participation in profession in research and science , meet with a fairly wide consensus .
this necessary realistic and pragmatic policy , however , which will have to be associate with the elimination of the practical obstacle identify a unquestionable factor in this inequality must , a far a we be concern , necessarily be base on the idea of complementarity , which be the only one capable of justify a proactive policy on the subject .
by have the opportunity to show their true merit , by eliminate a far a possible the barrier associate to the specific of their condition a woman , and not in the context of a conflict in which woman seem to be attack male privilege , woman will demonstrate the benefit to be gain by facilitate a situation where their professional career may flourish.In this way they will succeed in alter balance which be still not in their favour .
since the European Parliament choose to vote on a text that expressly resort to the quota policy which my report for an opinion have attempt to denounce in no uncertain term , and in spite of the general approach which I approve for the most part , I can do no other than abstain from the vote on Mrs McNally & apos ; s report .
second reading of the Florenz report ( A5-0006 / 2000 )
Madam President , today in the second reading we have vote on the amendment to the Directive on end-of-life vehicle .
I have reject the entire directive , not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendment to Article 5 / 4 have not receive an adequate majority here in the House .
I come from a country which manufacture 50 % of the car in the EU and it be precisely the free collection of end-of-life car which be so financially onerous and unacceptable .
here , in my opinion , the labour market be also considerably burden by the cost arise to these company .
this can not be a good thing in a European Union where we be ever mindful of employment .
I consider that this be a serious defect and that , in principle , it do not befit our legal system .
in my opinion , this directive be unacceptable for this reason .
Madam President , I would like to comment on the Florenz report .
I think that the vote have show that although the common position of the Council have be tone down , the major group here ( and above all the German delegate of the major group ) have not , thank God , succeed in destroy the heart of the directive , namely manufacturer responsibility .
unfortunately , there have be a tone down of the effective ecological material flow policy , i.e . through the obligatory risk assessment of material whose harmful effect on health have be know for year .
we know that lead , mercury , cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risk and numerous Community directive have succeed in restrict their usage without any risk assessment be make .
here , unfortunately , the European Parliament have bow to the interest of industry .
I be nevertheless extremely pleased that there be no majority for the amendment of Florenz , Lange and others who have actually seek to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumer solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicle .
I find this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I be pleased that it fail , that the attempt by one large government and the delegate of a large Member State do not gain a majority , by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on ground of the interest of it national industry .
Madam President , although I too have spend most of my life in fast car , I agree with my colleague , Mr Florenz , that the directive on scrap car must make it clear that vintage car be not include .
these splendid car do not constitute waste .
that be why I vote in favour of the amendment .
neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be a there be very great difference from one country & apos ; s statute to another & apos ; s .
in this way vehicle of historic value can be preserve for future generation .
we can not forget old car enthusiasts either , of whom there be more than 50 000 in Finland alone .
they be involve in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance .
- ( SV ) The parliamentary process concern this question have be confuse , to say the least .
before the vote at the plenary sitting , new amendment have be table such a have already be vote down by the Committee .
in the divide situation which have now arise , we therefore consider that the Council & apos ; s wording be the best .
we need a directive in this area , and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure .
the directive concern end-of-life vehicle will stand a an example for future legislation .
it be therefore important that the manufacturer & apos ; s liability should be clear.This should not in any way be jeopardise .
today , Parliament be examine , for the last time , this text on & apos ; end-of-life & apos ; vehicle and what be to be do with them : their destruction , a commendable intention with regard to our environment .
there be , however , two consideration which must certainly be deal with within this text .
first of all , who be to bear the financial cost of this destruction ?
we must all ensure that it be not always the same person , i.e . the vehicle owner , who pay .
he or she already pay enough in tax for this vehicle , which be a bottomless pit in financial term .
we have recently have cause to talk about the & apos ; polluter pay & apos ; principle.We should apply this principle rationally and calmly , correctly target and without ideology .
another essential point that must be include in this text be the express exclusion of vintage vehicle from it scope .
one might make the claim that there be no need to state it explicitly in writing because it be an obvious point , but I feel that it be a point that should be make in writing because there be every interest in adopt clear text .
so let u vote for these amendment in order to preserve these gem of the automobile industry .
these old vehicle be testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognise and respect by Europe , if we be not to water down each of our specific identity .
there be no lack of example amongst European text , and we all know how much debate and argument be cause by a lack of clarity and precision .
I only need to mention the case of Directives 79 / 409 and 92 / 43 .
the precise wording of text provide a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these text on a daily basis .
it be not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceeding for judge in any arena.That would not be fulfil our mission .
on the contrary , we must adopt crystal-clear text in order to limit legal dispute .
.
( NL ) That the Florenz report have cause such a stir have be prove by the powerful lobby machine which have be set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement .
I regret that the manufacturer have harangue the European Parliament and the Council with a whole ream of argument which either cut no ice or be simply false .
I dare say this because I take the trouble to go into the field and collect information from , among others , scrapyards which already recycle car component successfully .
they make it clear to me that the argument concern lack of safety , for example , be nonsense .
the car lobby be unsuccessful today and I be pleased about that .
the directive remain in place .
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the effort to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirement .
- My party oppose this measure and the propose amendment .
there be few thing more certain in life than tax , death and pollution .
however , there be also nothing more certain than EU environmental directive which have laudable intention but which actually fail to achieve their stated objective .
when it come to pollution , like sin , we be all against it , but from there it be a far cry from believe that just because a measure be propose against this evil it be necessarily good .
in fact , this directive , like so many others address environmental issue , be not good .
a be so often the case , it merely provide yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem , which will only serve to create more job for official , and cost the motor industry and consumer a great deal of money .
the one thing it will not do be solve the problem - it be a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut .
no one , not least my party , could begin to disagree that recycle should be encourage , but the best way to achieve that be to work with the market , not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity .
thus , a more appropriate way to encourage recycling be to tax manufacturer who do not increase the amount of recoverable material in their vehicle , to encourage private sector recycle company , through a package of tax incentive and assistance on comply with environmental requirement , and to incentivise the use of recycled material .
of course , these be area where the EU do not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction .
however , in the absence of these power , it should not seek to substitute a le effective measure .
instead , it should leave Member States to develop their own system , and avoid the tendency to interfere where it be not wanted and can do no good .
Berger Report ( A5-0007 / 2000 )
this proposal for a directive attempt to establish condition for the posting of worker who be third-country national , for the provision of cross-border service .
third-country national with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union .
until now , the restriction on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community worker have be very harsh .
it be therefore a positive step that the movement of worker within the European Union be be make easier , even when they be national of third country .
nevertheless , the proposal for a directive merely aim to allow them to move to another Member State when they be post there by an employer base in their country of normal residence.This mean that their scope for movement be limit to the duration of their posting and only to the Member State to which they be post .
this mean that this proposal & apos ; s fundamental aim be not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these worker , but merely to improve the position of the company provide service .
on the other hand , for the sake of simplify procedure some highly debatable amendment have be include in the Berger report , one example of which be the establishment of a common information service for card issue by a body in any Member State .
Berger Report ( A5-0007 / 2000 ) and Berger Report ( A5-0012 / 2000 )
it be with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposal for directive intend to facilitate the freedom of movement of worker who be national of a third country while facilitate the freedom of movement of service .
basically , these proposal introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country national legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide service in other Member States , a phenomenon currently obstruct by problem such a the need to obtain visa and work permit .
the first proposal for a directive will authorise business establish in a Member State which employ worker who be third country national to assign such employee to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide service there .
accord to the term of the directive , the employer would be simply require to request a service provision card for each employee concern .
logically , in order to be give such a card , the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be cover by a social security scheme .
the second proposal grant the same right to self-employed worker who be third country national .
while , basically , I subscribe to the European Commission proposal , nonetheless there be some condition which may lead to confusion .
that be why I be vote in favour of the amendment table by the rapporteur .
this will make it possible to clarify the term and thus prevent any misreading !
other amendment be intend to simplify the administrative procedure , for example by authorise Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issue card .
I feel an amendment of this type be essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often act a a brake on the proper application of new condition .
I can , therefore , only be delight at the adoption of these directive thus amended.We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union have to face so many problem .
this go against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrine in the founding treaty of this Union .
Marinho Report ( A5-0003 / 2000 ) :
we have serious reservation about the Council & apos ; s propose amendment .
how can we talk of increase the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judge in that Court because it be overstretch ?
the first measure would in fact cancel out the effect of the latter .
some people will say that perfection be not a realistic aim , but a brief look at the background should make our reservation more understandable to them :
on 1 January 1995 , the Council go back on the decision to increase the number of judge lay down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994 .
so what be do at Amsterdam ?
in that respect , nothing.On the contrary , extend the Community & apos ; s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar have increase the burden .
you will agree , furthermore , that the text adopt by this House always call for Community jurisdiction , and that include for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which be currently be draw up .
the increase in the number of CFI judge from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it have recently be accord to have a single judge rule on specific case be not real solution but mere decoy , grudgingly grant , which we have become aware of after the fact .
consequently , these proposal do not live up to the issue at stake.They represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judge to be increase to several hundred .
we can not agree to this , since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges be detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States .
the time have come , we feel , for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice .
this question can not be deal with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norm and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity .
be the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this ?
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report ( A5-0018 / 2000 )
- ( SV ) The most important task of the approach Intergovernmental Conference be to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States .
we therefore , of course , support the European Parliament & apos ; s now give the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference .
we nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limit to question which have to be resolve if it be to be possible for enlargement to take place .
we also argue this in November 1999 , and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 .
.
( FR ) In the opinion which it have just adopt on the convening of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , the European Parliament call for a & quot ; constitutional process to be launch & quot ; .
this determination to override nation with a legally supranational text be also express in the first meeting of the body responsible for draw up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights , which be really a closet constitution .
it be express again in the unbelievable excess perpetrate by the European Parliament which today in it vote on a resolution wish to cancel out the result of the free election in Austria .
the same determination to reduce nation to the level of mere administrative region be also evident on every page of the opinion issue by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference .
the key idea involve make qualified majority vote the general rule while modify the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority , of States and people , in order to increase the Commission & apos ; s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority States .
incidentally , the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission be ask for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amend in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament .
people will remember that this article , deal with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level , stipulate that for five year decision would still be take by unanimous vote in the Council and thereafter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system .
in France , both in the National Assembly and in the Senate , when this be be ratify , many member of the French parliament be reassure to hear that , in any case , the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making .
well , today , the same Minister of European Affairs who draw up the Treaty of Amsterdam , who have , in the meantime , become a European Commissioner , Mr Barnier , propose to decide , at the forthcoming IGC , that the Council will operate in these area by majority decision .
this be the type of mechanism we be continually subject to when play the game of European integration with the Brussels institution .
the French must be make aware not only that the purpose of all these operation be to eliminate their country a a responsible centre for decision making , but that furthermore every mean will be use to extract their consent .
if they yield , they be lose .
for it be their very mean of defence which be be eliminate one by one .
. ( da ) The Danish Social Democrats have today vote against the report on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference .
it be crucial for u that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be conclude before the end of the year 2000 so that there be no remain formality , such a the weighting of vote in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament , which place obstacle in the way of the enlargement of the EU .
we be therefore also very satisfied with the decision which be take on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December .
an unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delay the enlargement process .
that be something we do not want to see , and we have therefore vote against any such extension .
we nonetheless very much agree with our colleague that there be a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people be clear a to how the work be proceed .
.
( SV ) We be pleased that a limited agenda have be establish for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference .
possible future Member States ought to be involve in , and have an influence upon , the shaping of the EU of the future .
the election to the European Parliament in 1999 show perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centre upon Brussels .
with the convening of the forthcoming IGC , the process of European Union be topical once again .
once again the discussion be go to be monopolise by the Heads of State and Government .
in other word , fifteen people be go to have discussion and decide , behind closed door , on the fate of more than 350 million individual .
it be therefore easy to understand the public & apos ; s lack of interest , give the construction of Europe which be go on behind their back and in area which be not really of concern to them .
in fact , one only need look at the agenda of the IGC : the institution , enlargement and European defence .
the fact be that the prime concern be the strengthening of executive power , the development of closer relation with liberalism in the country of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe , particularly by increase military budget .
social Europe , use a a foil by the EU , have simply be eliminate from the agenda .
all this do be to legitimise the development , on the European scale , of resistance movement anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise worker & apos ; main claim towards the highest common denominator .
this be why I be vote against the report .
unfortunately , in the issue cover by the resolution on future subject for revision to the Treaty on European Union , nothing have so far be state about the need to review Article 7 , which deal with suspend a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the & quot ; found & quot ; principle of the Union , a lay down in Article 6 .
a the present crisis involve Austria have demonstrate , the Union have the right to protect itself .
nevertheless , the legal mechanism that exist in the Treaty be weak , difficult to apply politically and legally , do not define the power of the institution and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for process of major importance.Suspending a state be just such a process , and be to be condemn .
I therefore think that this issue should be include a a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda , and in itself this justify a thorough revision of the Treaties .
we feel that at present the central issue about convene an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties be far more important than the controversy take place here about the size of the agenda.They be also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulate proposal for new issue to be cover , and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament & apos ; s participation in it .
we feel that these issue result from the IGC & apos ; s appropriateness and it objective , a well a from the matter which will inevitably be discuss there .
we have doubt concern the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objective actually be address may be far remove from the change require to allow for the enlargement envisage .
this relate in particular to the intend agenda , particularly a regard the Amsterdam leftover , which suggest that unacceptable inner cabinet will be create in the future.This also identify area relate to the second and third pillar , which tend to be reflect in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union .
these be some of the basic reason why we do not agree with the aim of the motion for a resolution now before u .
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party have abstain on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report .
the text be overambitious , and Britain & apos ; s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the & quot ; Amsterdam left-overs & quot ; in order to prepare for enlargement , and not expand far beyond these .
there be currently a great deal of work under way in term of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institution .
expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaty would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation .
the key factor in this text a it have be amend , be the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporate into the treaty .
in our view , this would bring with it a complex legislative burden , and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explain to citizens what their exist right be .
our priority ( i.e . the & quot ; left-overs & quot ; ) must be :
the number and responsibility of Commissioners
weighting of vote in the Council
extension of QMV in area where it will benefit the UK and Europe ( but not Treaty change , defence matter , border control or taxation ) , and extension of codecision wherever QMV be extend
beyond this , we have concern that the & quot ; flexibility & quot ; or enhance cooperation suggestion be not appropriate at present .
the provision of Amsterdam be largely untested and allow more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement be be consider and applicant country be be ask to sign up to single market and other European legislation .
- ( SV ) In order to be able to influence development , the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than emerges from the present resolution , which display far too much disappointment and negativity about the decision which the European Council make in Helsinki in December 1999 .
the European Parliament and it Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought instead to have be more specific and concentrate on just a few point in addition to the Council decision in Helsinki , so state what it consider to be the most pressing matter for discussion , include the question of establish a public prosecutor to deal with crime against the institution of the European Union and their financial interest .
we Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threat which have be make to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference be not extended very considerably to include subject in addition to those leave over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997 .
the most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference be to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States .
I therefore , of course , support the European Parliament & apos ; s now give the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference .
I nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limit to question which have to be resolve if it be to be possible for the enlargement to take place .
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence .
joint resolution on Austria
Madam President , the Union for a Europe of Nations Group do not associate itself with the joint PPE / DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria follow the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservative and Jörg Haider & apos ; s Freedom Party .
this PPE / DE-PSE resolution commend the initiative take by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organise a sort of diplomatic boycott .
what we find most shocking be the fact that this joint intervention claim the authority of the Treaty , a if this state somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancel by the will of the head of government of neighbour country who in fact , in this instance , have carefully refrain from consult their own people .
whatever Jörg Haider & apos ; s verbal excess , which we of course deplore , the Austrians have make a democratic choice , and we must respect this .
in our opinion , it be clear that the left wing in the European Parliament , in association with the Austrian left wing which be defeat in the electoral arena , have mount a petty political campaign resort to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period .
although compare Haider to Hitler be a concept without any credibility whatsoever , it have nonetheless partly achieve it purpose in unsettle some PPE / DE Members of Parliament .
but , go beyond this petty political operation , what the majority in the European Parliament be afraid of most of all be that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria , which cause political life to stagnate and rot , may soon spread to the European system of co-management which be produce equally appalling result .
in order to prevent this threat to the system , it be ready to do anything , include overrule the outcome of free election , include set up a thought police , include establish a new form of totalitarianism .
Madam President , on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Front national , the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento sociale italiano , I should like to ask the question : in this outrageous interference in internal Austrian affair which the European Union have undertake in contravention of general international law , in contravention of the Treaties , in contravention of morality , who be pull the string ?
be this hysteria spontaneous ?
be it the product of mere foolishness or , more probably , of a deliberate strategy , which be the same throughout the world ?
who be impose their will on the nation of Europe , dare to stop them choose their own fate ?
underground network ?
the government of the United States , or of Israel ?
or their Socialist back-up troop who , in this House , have the cheek to thrust their value down our throat ?
what , then , be the value of these Socialists who feather their electoral nest in the last century by paint the idea of greater social justice in glowing colour for the benefit of the underprivileged , and who today be nothing more than the party of protect civil servant , full-time union official and state capitalism ?
what be the value of the Belgian Socialist Party , which only go from paedophilia scandal to corruption scandal , via Vandam and Agusta ?
what be the value of the French Socialist Party , which extort money from all the town council under it thumb in the Urba , Sages and Graco scandal ?
the party lead by François Mitterrand , decorate with the emblem of Marshal Pétain & apos ; s Vichy government , the party whose lead light have just be catch red-handed once again , live a life of luxury on the public fund embezzle from the student & apos ; mutual insurance company .
I shall not even mention the instance of corruption in the Italian Socialist Party , because it do not do to kick a man when he be down , still le when he be dead and go .
I shall , however , mention the Spanish Socialist Party which have just form an alliance with the butcher of Albacete and which settle it account with Basque nationalist by hire contract killer .
I shall also mention the German Socialist Party which dare to preach to u about the second world war , when it be international socialist in the way that it peer be National Socialists , still goose-stepping , the party of the Waffen SS ...
( the President cut the speaker off )
Madam President , I have a major problem with this resolution .
finally , I abstain on the vote for a number of reason .
I be in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment , talk about reject the interference of the EU in the formation of government of Members States but I have to abstain because it just follow on the condemnation of xenophobia , racism , etc . and I felt that it might be misinterpret .
however , I do wonder about the wisdom of this .
firstly , there be the question of try to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequence of that .
I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and it reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that be go to affect public opinion there .
at the moment it seem that the Haider Party be get more support rather than le from the opposition by outside government .
even America have now say that it be consider break off diplomatic relation .
we wonder if this be actually feed the flame of xenophobia and the party and people that support it .
I really think that people should be extremely cautious .
if you want to combat xenophobia and racism , and I believe that we should , we need to look at the root cause .
we need to look at the people who vote for these party , and understand why this situation arise .
it be not a situation that most people in this Parliament want , but we need to be careful about the approach we take , so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we be try to achieve .
Madam President , I strongly refute any statement , demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism .
I passionately defend Europe & apos ; s heritage of human right and the rule of law .
I disagree , however , for this very reason , with the senseless action take by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have result in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States .
this be not the way to fight extremism .
it may even be a way of do extremism a great deal of good .
the torrent of confusion and rash action that have be unleash over Austria have blow thing out of all proportion.It have cause considerable distress to decent citizen and evokes risk that have previously not even be consider .
there be an irreconcilable contradiction between position adopt in the name of human right and the rule of law , but which at the same time attack the fundamental right of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenet of the rule of law , in this case the standard lay down in the Treaties .
what be we actually seek to achieve in embark on an Intergovernmental Conference ?
a Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14 , or even fewer ?
we support Europe , a Europe which do honour to all the action that have bring u to this point , a Europe which respect the Treaties and the law and a Europe which need Austria .
this need to be say !
Madam President , I be delighted and proud that this Parliament have , by an enormous majority , condemn the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporate Mr Haider & apos ; s Freedom Party .
Mr Haider have demonstrate , over the past year by both word and deed , that he deserve to be exclude from normal democratic discourse .
not only have he admire Adolf Hitler , praise the Waffen SS , and refuse to condemn a terrorist bombing that kill four Roma , but also in Carinthia have be a member of the regional government .
he have lead effort to end provision for Austria & apos ; s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrant .
some have say it be not right for u to interfere in Austrian politics .
they be wrong .
European Union Treaties make it incumbent on u to protect fundamental right .
some have say we have to accept the result of democratic election .
however , democratic election do not make democrat of those who have threaten democracy .
there be the tragic monument of the Holocaust , the death of 6 million Jews , to those who argue the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s .
however , we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition .
Leopards do not change their spot .
the real culprit be Austria & apos ; s Christian Democrat act a Judas goat to resurrect a threat to Europe that we think have die Berlin in 1945 .
Madam President , we have just pass a resolution which condemn the racist and xenophobic record of Jörg Haider & apos ; s Freedom Party in Austria , which have welcome action by our government to cut off political relation with any government of which he be part , and which send our support to anti-racist group within the democratic majority of the Austrian people .
we warn that this coalition , if it be form today , unacceptably legitimise the extreme right , directly in contradiction with the principle of peace and reconciliation , which bring u together in this European Union .
these be the value which we ask of others who seek to join u .
this European Parliament require the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria , and threaten to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happen .
I be proud to support such a resolution .
though our proposal to withdraw political invitation to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament have not carry today , I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the power of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be take .
I shall take the floor very briefly , Madam President .
I respect Parliament & apos ; s wish , a it have be express , but I must also say that the self-determination of people can not be call into question , even by the European Parliament .
the document be unfair both to Austrian Members of the European Parliament , and to member of the Austrian national parliament , and it smack slightly of jealousy and political interest , but also of business .
I do not believe that these signal will change the citizen & apos ; indifference to Europe .
the Austrian extreme right have be gift an unwarranted present .
I very much welcome the position take by the Italian Radicals ; and I say this while make a clear historic and material distinction between Italian liberal and Austrian liberal .
I have not be able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of it premises.What we have here , first and foremost , be an incredibly ominous mixture of power , arrogance and impotence on the part of the European Union .
not only do these decision conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institution of the Union more power than that to which they be entitle but , worst of all , their effect will be counter-productive .
they will not weaken Mr Haider and the FPÖ.On the contrary , they will strengthen them .
we shall obtain the very opposite of what we want .
that be not how you combat racism and a swing to the right .
. ( da ) The Left & apos ; s Members of the European Parliament attach importance to the fact that , with today & apos ; s decision , Parliament have NOT support the fourteen prime minister & apos ; diplomatic sanction against Austria .
the Left & apos ; s Members of Parliament therefore support the Liberal decision & apos ; s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in Austria or elsewhere .
we attach crucial importance to applying , if necessary , the new provision under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which , by it action , infringes fundamental citizen & apos ; right by mean of discrimination and such like will have it voting right in the EU & apos ; s Council of Ministers remove .
- ( EL ) The Freedom Party & apos ; s participation in the Austrian Government be a dangerous development for the European Union & apos ; s political future .
it be a & apos ; Trojan horse & apos ; which be unfortunately reappear in Europe larger than ever since the Second World War .
the European Parliament and the Union & apos ; s government must politically isolate a government that include admirer of Nazism and advocate of xenophobia .
our vote in no way constitute an endorsement of the signatory to this compromise resolution , their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious .
some of these party , despite declare themselves to be republican and democratic , adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right , either out of connivance or a a vote-winning ploy , if only in openly and hypocritically blame the immigrant worker in our country for unemployment , and generally make their life more difficult .
more generally , those signatory who take part in or have take part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right have manage to gain since their policy , devote exclusively to the interest of big business , have not include take action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engender , and have thus facilitate the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right .
this week we hear the first political cry of the new-born Europe .
by staunchly and speedily denounce the participation of Jörg Haider & apos ; s xenophobic and anti-European party in the Austrian government , a situation without precedent since the second world war , the European Union have come into it political birthright and have confirm that it be not merely an economic and financial Community , a large market , a & quot ; Europe of shopkeeper & quot ; .
it be a part of it future which be at stake right now , part of it very essence , it heart and soul .
the European Parliament be the first to speak up .
the appeal by the European Socialists , on the initiative of Olivier Duhamel , raise awareness and enable there to be a firm and immediate political response to this unheard of and intolerable situation .
a firm attitude which the 14 European States have demonstrate unanimously and promptly , through Mr Guterres , by condemn the risk of the Austrian political situation get out of control .
this courageous stance turn a new page in the construction of Europe .
a return to the root , at last , for a Community build on the basis of the determination to turn our back on a past history mar by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist value of openness and tolerance .
Europe have manage to stand up to condemn unacceptable event .
however , a it lack the legal instrument to support this political will , since the sanction stipulate under Article 7 of the Treaties be virtually impossible to apply , will it be able to keep it head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of it entire institutional structure ?
the whole credibility of Europe be at stake today , before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracy of the former eastern bloc to join u tomorrow .
from now on Europe must put it word into action if it wish to show the world the scope of it rediscovered ambition .
at this time when we be vote on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo-Nazis in the government of a European Union Member State , I must express my regret regard a compromise text which be particularly lack in backbone .
I be vote in favour of it because it be inconceivable that the European Parliament , after it excellent political debate yesterday , should not adopt a stance on this matter .
personally , however , I shall continue to fight against the extreme right , to urge people to sign a petition to demand measure which may go a far a the exclusion of Austria , and to organise a major public demonstration in Lille on Saturday at 3 p.m .
Fascism and neo-Nazism be cancer !
the foul monster have be reawaken !
for me there be no question of allow them to develop and to flourish without fight with all our might .
Europe be bear out of a desire for peace , freedom and tolerance .
there be no question of it allow xenophobic , racist and anti-Semitic minister to be tolerate at within it .
do not count on me to keep quiet , without do or say anything .
in yesterday & apos ; s debate in the European Parliament some Members of this Parliament express worry that we be interfere in the internal affair of a Member State .
such a concern be misplace .
the European Parliament have never be slow to comment on development in Member States with which they disagree .
we have condemn Basque and Irish terrorism .
we have oppose racism and the infringement of the right of minority .
it be our responsibility a a parliament , particularly a the democratically elected voice of the European Union , to comment on current political development in Austria which be in conflict with the policy of this parliament .
by comment and make our view know we be not prevent any party in Austria from form a coalition government .
we be nonetheless , a be our right a well a our responsibility , tell them that if they go ahead then there be consequence arise from such a decision and in fact we be warn them beforehand .
others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement .
such a view be not only a political cop-out , it be positively dangerous .
in reach an agreement with Jörg Haider and his party , the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirm political respectability on right wing extremism and also give them access to power - both of which they will utilise a a launching pad for even greater electoral success .
that be why the European Union must make it position clear regard the current situation in Austria .
- ( SV ) We have vote in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who be expose to xenophobia and racism .
we have also vote in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that Jörg Haider stand for .
we be nonetheless very critical of the method which the 14 Member States have employ on this issue .
the resolution make no clear reference to respect for the Member States & apos ; national identity and constitutional tradition in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty .
what be also miss be a paragraph concern the EU & apos ; s share responsibility for the social and political development in Europe and Austria which have be among the prior condition for Mr Haider & apos ; s electoral success .
today , a previously in the history of Europe , right-wing extremism be the result of insecure social and economic condition of life .
the policy of cut-backs which have follow in the wake of adjust to EMU have promote the success of right-wing extremism .
a radical policy to promote security and justice in each country be the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe .
- ( DE ) I be make this statement on behalf of the CSU .
it be intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State .
it have no right to do so .
instead of prematurely condemn the FPÖ and the Austrian Government which be be form , there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policy of the coalition .
only after such critical appraisal of the future policy of the party involve in the coalition discussion can a decision be make a to whether this government be contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe .
this do not mean that we sympathise with Haider .
the CSU European delegate have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ .
however , a politician we must ask the question why 27 % of the Austrian population vote for a party such a the FPÖ at the election in October 1999 .
we must concern ourselves with the reason for this and try to deal with the reason behind such result .
only by tackle the argument and policy of the FPÖ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics .
however , the resolution of the European Parliament do not question the reason for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offer no option for resolve the problem .
for these reason the CSU European delegate be against this resolution .
it be with these phrase that Albert Camus , at the close of the long allegorical novel describe the difficult fight of the citizen of the town of Oran against the plague , remind u , at the close of the Second World War , that the fight against Nazism , & quot ; the brown plague & quot ; a it be term at the time , could not enjoy a definitive victory .
that because racial hatred , xenophobic violence , fear and rejection of what be different , have deep root in all that be basest in humanity , they may re-emerge at any moment and take over any group of human being .
in this light , the event we be see in Austria must be see a tragic .
for the first time since the Second World War , a party which be openly pro-Nazi , racist and xenophobic have gain access to power in a European country .
this human diversity be our main source of wealth , and this be the reason why it be my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it , wherever it may exist .
for all these reason I vote most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria .
Jörg Haider & apos ; s rise to power , with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government , be a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism have give birth .
the success of the Austrian Freedom Party owe a much to the endorsement of respectability provide by the Austrian right wing and social democrat a to the policy of the latter , whose social disaster pave the way for extreme right-wing populism .
the resolution stipulate possible diplomatic mean to isolate the new government politically without even mention the root cause of the resurgence of Fascism .
it can be explain by the feeling of helplessness of the people who be the victim of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling class to promote strong government in order to take their policy of austerity and deregulation ever further .
in order to oppose the xenophobic statement of an apprentice dictator who be nostalgic for the Third Reich , we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians oppose to Fascism .
this be why we be vote in favour of this resolution in spite of it hypocritical reference to a & apos ; European democratic model & apos ; which bear more resemblance to a fortress which track down , expels and imprisons immigrant without the proper paper , when it be not opening file on teenager .
- ( DE ) I have just vote against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government be form between the ÖVP and the FPÖ .
I consider the casting of Jörg Haider a & quot ; Europe & apos ; s scapegoat & quot ; ( or even worse , neo-Nazi and Super Racist ) to be counterproductive .
of course I , in no way , agree with the publicised statement of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime .
however , I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the event in Austria will only multiply Haider & apos ; s adherent .
the EU must not do him an invaluable PR service .
the strength of the FPÖ can be trace back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialist must bear the main responsibility .
it be only after they unsuccessfully solicit the FPÖ to tolerate a minority government and , obviously in vain , offer the Freedom Party ministerial post , that the SPÖ begin it massive campaign against Haider .
it turn it threatened loss of power into an & quot ; heroic battle for the preservation of value & quot ; and an imminent , pure-and-simple & quot ; decision between democracy and non-democracy & quot ; .
this be a smear on the voter in my neighbouring country which I can not condone .
we German Christian Democrats use another strategy in the battle against extremist and clearly disassociate ourselves from them .
we reveal the hollowness of the republican who be nationalistic , xenophobic and anti-minority .
today the republican be no longer represent in most local parliament .
the German approach be no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again .
it can not be copy arbitrarily since each Member State have it own specific condition .
the ÖVP ( Austrian People & apos ; s Party ) , whose presence at European level we have also come to take for grant , be dare to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria .
it can only succeed if agreement be make which be solidly base on compliance with democratic principle .
the Council have become prematurely involved without wait for the result of the coalition negotiation or a programme of government .
this condemnation be a unacceptable a the threatened break off of official contact with the Austrian Republic .
sound democracy mean be alert and not blind in one eye .
we must take up a reasoned offensive against radical on both the right and the left .
I would have like to see the same outrage in Europe when the socialist be prepare to make common cause with the successor to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the DDR .
in the meantime , they have be form government in German federal state .
I fully support the statement make by Commissioner Prodi in today & apos ; s session .
he speak of the task of not isolate Member States but of do everything to unite them in common European value .
- ( FR ) I vote against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria .
Austria be a free , independent and sovereign country .
consequently , neither the Council , the Commission nor the European Parliament have the right to interfere in the internal administration of a Member State .
the Austrian election be hold in a free , proper and democratic manner .
any interference by the European institution in this country be therefore unacceptable ; it be in violation of the European Treaty ( Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam ) .
nevertheless , these same institution show no reluctance to accept Turkey a a candidate for membership of the European Union , despite it well-known human right violation .
nothing of this nature have yet occur in Austria .
on the other hand , if tomorrow the government of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational body , then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed.In such circumstance will it even be worth have election ?
this be not the way to create the condition for the nation of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future .
- ( FR ) The vote which have just take place in this Chamber be a historic one for it be the first time we have ever debate the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such anxiety .
I believe there be circumstance when the question of principle and institutional regulation be obliterate .
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental value of the Union .
I urge the Commission to be le cautious .
in this resolution , Parliament be assume it responsibility .
have say that , in my opinion , the resolution adopt today be the absolute minimum , the very least we could do .
personally I argue in favour of a rather harder line , and I support Amendments Nos 1 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 , a well a the oral amendment table by the Socialist Group .
in fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relation with the representative of an Austrian Government which include member of the Austrian Freedom Party .
include Jörg Haider & apos ; s party in a coalition government make the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe , and set an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate country .
the Austrian People & apos ; s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this .
it be our fundamental value which be at stake here.As the democratically elect representative of the European people , we have no choice .
we must reject what be unacceptable , a our constituent demand .
because , when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces , failure to oppose be tantamount to capitulation .
I abstain in the vote on adopt the resolution .
I condemn Jörg Haider & apos ; s racist and xenophobic policy .
however , I can not accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State .
I can not therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution , and I can not vote in favour of the resolution , even though it would be a vote against the extreme right .
- ( SV ) Obviously , the political leader of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Haider and his party .
the political leader of Europe be entitle to express their view of political development in another Member State , just a a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politician in a local authority .
Finland & apos ; s experience , however , be that integration , rather than isolation , be the better way of combat antidemocratic force .
I therefore vote against paragraph 2 of the resolution , which presuppose that all party have respect for human right .
the EU Presidency & apos ; s & quot ; common reaction & quot ; against the formation of the government in Austria be legally unjustified .
the treaty do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States .
nor should we isolate the force in Austria which wish to work for human right .
despite these objection of mine to the Council & apos ; s action and despite my view that it be better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactic , it be important to show clearly where the European Parliament stand on question of racism , which be why I vote in favour of the resolution at the final vote .
that conclude the vote .

approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
the Minutes of the sit on Thursday 3 February have be distribute .

I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning , since obviously you do not have them and I must apologise for this .
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes .
Madam President , on a point of order .
the BBC this morning report that a British Member of this House , hold a senior position within his delegation , continue to offer strategic advice to private client , but do not state in the Register of Interests who these client be .
the people of Europe have a right to expect their representative to keep the public interest separate from private profit , but they can only be sure that this be be do in all case if the information be both publicly available and easily accessible .
thank you , Mr Davies .
I shall look into this matter with the College of Quaestors .
Madam President , on a point of order .
a this be the first Valentine & apos ; s Day of the new millennium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fit for this House to mark this day by make a firm commitment to tackle heart disease , the biggest killer in the European Union .
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment make today at the Winning Hearts Conference that every child bear in the new millennium have the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffer from avoidable cardiovascular disease .
happy Valentine & apos ; s Day !
Madam President , I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raise by Mr Davies about the very serious allegation make on BBC radio this morning .
I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who be name in this particular BBC interview be not run their company from this Parliament or from parliamentary office , because that would be a very serious matter indeed .
in the past the British Conservatives & apos ; double standard have bring the United Kingdom & apos ; s House of Commons into disrepute , and there be a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament .
thank you , Mr Murphy .
a I inform Mr Davies , I promise to look into this matter this very even with the quaestor .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I have already write to you on a number of occasion concern how point of order be raise in the House .
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies be speak .
why do he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleague also have a consultancy that be under investigation by the BBC ?
be this House go to let it agenda be determine by scurrilous report on a programme which base it news item on lie , or be it go to get down to serious work and address the challenge face Europe ?
gentleman , obviously the quaestor who look into this matter be not go to be base their assessment just on information from radio programme .
they will look into the matter thoroughly .
Madam President , I believe I be express the feeling of a great number of Members of Parliament in most of the political group when I say that the message which the President of the Commission send to the new Austrian Chancellor a week ago create some unease .
be it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wish for success , or to say , & quot ; I be sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment a show by your predecessor to liberty , democracy , respect for human right and fundamental freedom & quot ; , or indeed that he await productive and constructive cooperation ?
this be why , Madam President , I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he mean to give these word , so that nobody , absolutely nobody , can use this message , which be unusual and unwise , to say the least , to contribute , and that include counter to the intention of Mr Prodi , towards make the dangerous political operation take place in Austria a commonplace .
thank you , Mr Wurtz .
I would ask you , lady and gentleman , not to start a debate at this point.This be just a procedural motion .
let me remind you , Mr Wurtz , that we shall be see Mr Prodi tomorrow.He be go to make a statement on the Commission & apos ; s programme .
naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him question in the speech you make follow this statement , just a Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you .
I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time , if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agree .
Madam President , it be with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raise here twice before .
I have already tell you on a number of occasion that we , on behalf of the Dutch contingency , would like a Dutch television channel .
there be now 28 channel here in this Parliament , include two Greek , one Portuguese , one Finnish and one Belgian , but still no Dutch , and a many a seven English , six German and six French .
I be promise back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January .
it be now February and we be still wait .
I would ask you once again to work on this .
I wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy be at work here prevent a Dutch channel from be transmit by satellite .
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel , let me say how disappointed I be , because I personally think this problem have be resolve long ago .
I have clearly receive your series of message on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti have an answer for you .
I shall therefore , with your permission , give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion .
Madam President , a my dear friend Elly will know , I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleague happy .
I would like to assure you a quaestor in charge of this issue that we have have technical discussion about the various channel on television and radio , and I have already start mail colleague in this connection .
if it be of any comfort to her , the Irish have not get their channel yet either .
there seem to be intractable technical problem but we be definitely work on it .
thank you for give me the opportunity to clarify this .
I be not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassure on the ground that the Irish Members too be unable to receive a national channel .
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel .
thank you , Mrs Banotti , and also the other quaestor for your effort to achieve this .
Madam President , I should like to tell Mr Wurtz that the Commission & apos ; s doctrine be not the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty and that , until proved otherwise , we be not in the situation where Articles 6 and 7 would be applicable .
Austria , therefore , be perfectly entitle to form it government and the President of the Commission be perfectly entitle , and even duty bound , to offer Austria his best wish .
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other member of his party , the French Communist mayor , be send bulldozer against immigrant hostel in France .
agenda
the next item be the final version of the draft agenda a draw up by the Conference of Presidents , pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure .
a ) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday :
President .
this would then give u , for Wednesday & apos ; s sit , the two Council statement on the coherence of Union policy with development policy and on the UN & apos ; Human Rights & apos ; sit , follow by the joint debate on Cyprus and then the report by Mr Swoboda , Mr Corrie , Mrs Frassoni and Mr Knörr Borràs .
be there anyone who wish to speak on behalf of these group in favour of this proposal ?
since no one wish to speak , I shall put this proposal to the vote .
( Parliament give it assent ) Relating to Thursday :
President.I have receive several propose amendment relate to the topical and urgent subject of major importance .
on the subject of human right , I have receive two proposal for addition : one from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party for an item entitle & apos ; Cambodia & apos ; and the other from the Group of the Greens , for an item entitle & apos ; Pinochet & apos ; .
a you know , we can only include five item in the & apos ; Human Rights & apos ; section .
accord to the list give in the final version of the agenda , there be already four item .
we can therefore table only one additional item .
who wish to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambodia ?
Madam President , it be remarkable that the European Parliament have not yet adopt a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet , despite the fact that international arrest warrant have already be issue .
since the Belgian Government & apos ; s appeal to a higher court be declare admissible last week and since the decision have essentially not yet be take , it be important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message , a message which should signify that nobody can escape a just trial .
it be inconceivable that the European Parliament , which quite rightly pay so much attention to respect human right , should fail to adopt a clear stance on this .
Madam President , this matter be far too serious to be deal with by mean of an urgent procedure at this time .
firstly , the European Parliament have already express it opinion on the subject of General Pinochet , but , furthermore , there be certain question to be bear in mind .
the first be that this matter be sub judice in several European country , and I would like to remind Members that there be still no European judicial area nor a European legal system .
we be in favour of the International Criminal Court , but it do not yet exist .
secondly , there be currently a democratically elected government in Chile , lead by Ricardo Núñez , whose first declaration be that all those who have commit this type of crime must face justice , and I would remind you that the Chilean justice system , which be independent , be currently examine 60 complaint lodge against General Pinochet , concern his crime against humanity .
I believe that this be a serious issue which we be oblige to follow up , but it should not be deal with by mean of urgent procedure .
we believe that justice should be do in this case , but this be not the most appropriate procedure .
( Parliament reject the proposal ) President .
we now come to the third proposal which be for & apos ; Environmental disaster in the water of the Danube & apos ; , a proposal table by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance .
be there a Member who wish to speak in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , lady and gentleman , what have occur in a tributary of the Danube be consider by many expert to be an accident on an environmental scale a serious a the scale of the Chernobyl disaster .
it affect not only Romania , but also Yugoslavia and , in fact , the entire Danube basin .
we consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swiftly to this situation , and I think that Parliament must make it position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject .
( Parliament give it assent ) President .
still relate to Thursday & apos ; s sit , the PPE Group have request that Mrs Cederschiöld & apos ; s report on increase protection by penal sanction against counterfeit in connection with the introduction of the euro should be bring forward to Wednesday a the last item on the agenda .
be there a Member who wish to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , the agenda have be rearrange so many time that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal .
it be not a very time-consuming matter , but it be extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delay .
it be in fact about protect the euro against counterfeiting , which be an extremely urgent matter .
we have try to drive this proposal through .
I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it .
( Parliament give it assent )
relate to Friday : President .
relate to Friday , on Friday morning we have an oral question on postal service and the Group of the Party of European Socialists be request that the motion for resolution should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in Brussels , a envisage in the final version of the draft agenda .
be there a Member who wish to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , with apology to my friend , Enrique Barón Crespo , I should like to speak against this proposal .
I be surprised it have even be make , because we come to an agreement follow an exchange in the Conference of Presidents .
I think that your proposal , Madam President , to keep the debate and the vote separate , with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date , be a reasonable one .
the reason be a follow : this issue concern no le than 1 800 000 employee within the European Union .
we already have a directive .
it be not an old one , it be issue in 1997 .
decide upon future policy line , with a view to a new directive , rather hastily , without have have time to consult the trade union or have discussion with all the social partner , I feel , run counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matter which directly involve the social operator .
I propose , therefore , that we should keep the arrangement a per the agenda , with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date .
Madam President , I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation , and I be go give this explanation before the whole House .
we have reach this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents .
at the time , I do not know that Commissioner Bolkestein be go to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter .
my group have debate this matter and considers that , give the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area , it be appropriate that Parliament make an initial statement , regardless of any action it may take in the future , so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week & apos ; s debate .
Madam President , I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this be about .
it have nothing to do with any dispute on the substance ; it be just about the following question : when will the Commission - have already have a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive ?
our sole intention in table the motion be to ensure that the deadline which be promise be now finally adhere to , and it be therefore important that we act a quickly a possible .
that be why I should like to support the Social Democrats & apos ; request to hold the vote on Friday .
( Parliament give it assent )
Madam President , a you know the Cederschiöld report have be take off Thursday & apos ; s agenda.That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday .
since we will be very press for time in the topical and urgent debate , in view of the many matter to be address in an hour and a half , I simply want to ask whether the sessional service might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there be sufficient speaking time .
in general the way in which sitting have be manage in recent week seem to me to have be very chaotic .
last Thursday speak time be extremely tight and then suddenly we have between one and one-and-a-half hour when there be nothing on the agenda and we have to wait for the vote .
on Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda .
that be absolutely absurd .
I really should like to ask that a review be carry out of the way in which sitting be manage .
this sound perfectly feasible.We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour , consider the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschiöld & apos ; s report .
this be all I be talk about here , just that .
Madam President , I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday , which you have not yet announce .
I understand that there be no argument about the fact that the Council declaration , on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights , be not go to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions , and that this declaration have be propose for the plenary part-session in March , so that it may be deliver in a solemn and formal way .
I understand that there be agreement on this issue .
Madam President , this afternoon , in this Chamber , reference be make to a series of report on the BBC Today programme this morning , which claim that certain of my colleague be run personal lobbying company or somehow misuse their position a Members of this House .
these be serious allegation .
they be completely untrue , malicious , politically bias and be broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood .
we be take legal advice .
my colleague & apos ; register of interest be complete .
if we find that any Member of this House or their employee collaborate with the BBC in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House .
quite , we agree absolutely .
B ) Sittings of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels
sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative
. ( FR ) Madam President , lady and gentleman , Commissioners and member of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I be give the task of draw up the European Parliament & apos ; s report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III .
upon referral to committee , we examine over a hundred amendment and , so far , 17 amendment , some of which have already be present in committee , have once again be table .
before discuss the content of the resolution , I should like to inform you of the element which I take account of and which guide my work a rapporteur .
first of all , I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative , found on the principle of transnationality and innovation .
this programme constitute a driving force for development on the European scale .
INTERREG be one of the four Community initiative schedule for the period 2000-2006 , and be the one with the largest budget for implementation , i.e . EUR 4.875 billion a oppose to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time .
the INTERREG initiative , create in 1990 , be build upon the wish to make the region of Europe ready for a & apos ; Europe without frontier & apos ; in the context of establish the great single market .
at the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996 , the INTERREG CIP have incorporate new strand contribute to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution network .
these programme promote cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encourage balance development of the Community area .
the INTERREG III programme , for which we have before u today the guideline issue by the European Commission , pursuant to the term of European Community Regulation No 1260 de 1999 lay down general provision on the Structural Funds , continue these measure .
the new INTERREG programme , in the form in which we have receive it , take into consideration the need engender by enlargement to the country of Eastern and Central Europe and to island region and most remote region .
the Commission propose redistribute the INTERREG funding a follow : between 50 and 80 % for strand A , 6 % for strand C , and the remainder for strand B , i.e . from 14 up to a maximum of 44 % .
the European Commission draw up the list of eligible region for strand A and strand B . It base it assessment principally on the map of region eligible during the previous programming period .
the most remote region may benefit from support under strand B . The Commission draw up a list of priority area and eligible measure which for strand A be not comprehensive , but be comprehensive for strand B . The Commission reserve the option to , at a later date , put forward topic it consider important to the exchange of experience and strengthen cooperation between region , for strand C .
the adoption procedure for the programme be establish by the general regulation on Structural Funds .
proposal be draw up by Member States and be submit for approval to the European Commission , which check their conformity with the general guideline , adopt .
these proposal must include a number of element , an overview of the cross-border or transnational priority and strategy , a description of the measure necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan .
I belong to the great majority of Members of Parliament who vote in favour of continue the INTERREG Community Initiative Programme.I regret that Parliament be not inform about the appraisal of the previous programme , which would have enable the new measure implement to reach optimum efficiency , but I acknowledge that this be not an easy operation .
in promote cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation , this cross-disciplinary instrument be the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intend to encourage harmonious and balance development of the Community territory .
an integrated development policy for all rural area in the European Union be therefore need , consist of the following element : an integrate , multi-sectoral approach , simplification of administrative procedure , improvement of the partnership between European institution and national and local actor and protection of the environment .
in it 1998 policy paper , Agenda 2000 , the Commission set out two key principle on which rural development policy should be base : the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for develop rural area .
the first principle mean create a new & apos ; pact & apos ; between farmer and society , make the farmer & apos ; steward of the countryside & apos ; and ensure that society be prepare to pay for the environmental service need to safeguard the countryside & apos ; s recreation value .
the second principle be base on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunity in rural area be outside the traditional agricultural sector , so that a complete development programme which integrate rural development policy with agricultural sector policy need to be implemented.In this way rural development be become a pillar of the CAP .
the LEADER Community initiative be launch in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measure by adapt them to local need .
the following objective be set : improve the development potential of rural area by call upon local initiative ; promote the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector ; disseminate this knowledge to other rural area .
LEADER I apply to the rural area cover by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b , and 217 local action group participate in it , with financing of EUR 1 155 million .
LEADER II ( 1994-1999 ) , for which a total evaluation have , unfortunately , not yet be complete , have a wider scope than LEADER I : there be probably over 800 beneficiary and the sum allocate , after reallocation of resource , probably amount to over EUR 4 000 million .
in October 1999 , follow the success of LEADER I and LEADER II , the Commission decide to extend the initiative .
for the 2000-2006 period provision have be make , unfortunately , only for a total contribution of EUR 2 020 million , and an indicative allocation for each Member State have be set .
LEADER + differs from the previous stage in that all rural area will be eligible.It be also more ambitious , and better gear to the challenge which rural area will have to meet .
the main change be a follow : all rural area will be eligible to benefit from LEADER + ; the selection criterion for local measure will be more rigorous ; integrate local development plan will be introduce a priority theme , such a the use of information technology , improve the quality of life , and add value to local product .
I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because , a I be say , it emphasise the innovative development strategy and because it be more ambitious , even though there be still the need to make the criterion by which area qualify a rural more flexible so a not to penalise rural area with high or low population density .
I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skill and for the implementation of joint project between different area of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measure already in existence , such a the Carrefours .
I share the Commission & apos ; s preference for the use of global grant while urge , however , that the accounting requirement of national and regional authority should be precisely and painstakingly define .
I regret the delay with which LEADER , a be the case with the other three initiative , be present to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entail for the whole procedure .
finally , I be concern by the paucity of the amount allocate , if you consider , in addition , that this time the programme be available to all the country of the Union and will be implement for a year longer than the previous LEADER II .
I would like to thank the Commission service for their helpfulness and cooperation , and I would like to thank my colleague in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have make through their amendment .
Madam President , lady and gentleman , my report on EQUAL take the form of an opinion deliver a part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative , whose objective be to promote transnational cooperation and through it new method of combat all form of discrimination and inequality in connection with the labour market .
the report be a major undertaking because it also incorporate opinion from four further committee - from the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , the Committee on Women & apos ; s Rights and Equal Opportunities , and the Committee on Citizens & apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
this Community initiative succeed the two forerunner programme ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT and have a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.8 billion .
the initiative adopt a completely new approach , which be to develop innovative employment model within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnership .
the intention be clear : target project be to be develop at transnational level , project which be base on the employment policy guideline of employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunity .
this objective be very much to be welcome and also meet with a broad consensus in this House .
in addition , EQUAL should fee into the National Action Plans for employment and it implementation should be able to be monitor through these Action Plans .
it be an important Community initiative which , together with the three other initiative , URBAN , LEADER and INTERREG , be finance out of the Structural Funds .
in my report I have try to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnership .
I consider technical support to be necessary but , give the problem with the former TAOs , no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament & apos ; s approval so a to prevent political responsibility from be pass down to the technical assistance level .
nevertheless , technical assistance be necessary .
particular attention be also pay to the dissemination of result and learn from each other by identify best practice , with special emphasis on mainstreaming .
I have endeavour to secure the widest possible support for the report .
this have mean a reduction in the number of amendment - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which have also create numerous opportunity for compromise .
a compromise have now also be reach on the issue of asylum seeker .
however , in this context , Madam President , to allow u to work out the detail , I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be hold not tomorrow but on Wednesday .
I believe that it be important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission be also oblige to take into consideration the constructive proposal make by the European Parliament , because Parliament put the appropriation for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so a to ensure that Members & apos ; idea be also reflect in this Community initiative .
in this connection , the European Parliament be also justify in insist that it should be possible to amend the thematic priority only after a further hearing in Parliament .
EQUAL should live up to it name , and this be my firm intention .
it should provide equal opportunity for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union .
it should prevent society from splinter .
it should prevent exclusion from be part of everyday life .
everyone should be give the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age , gender or origin .
that be my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelm support !
Madam President , it be in itself an achievement that we be have this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it be an achievement that I be here tonight because Air France cancel my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I be here !
just a year ago when the Commission produce it proposal around Agenda 2000 it ax the URBAN initiative .
yet we a politician know that there be a groundswell of support for continue this initiative into the year 2000 .
Parliament , therefore , can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn .
urban policy have always be at the forefront of EU policy .
in my Member State , for example , we be develop a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce be look at the problem of urban community .
with eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban area , it be right that we help our most deprived community to tackle the all too familiar problem of deprivation , social exclusion , joblessness , crime , drug dependency and all the problem that be associate with that .
for example , in my own region , in Manchester , the URBAN Community initiative have be a tremendous success .
urban fund have be invest in one of the most deprived neighbourhood in the UK , in Moss Side .
the Millennium Youth Park project be help to get young people re-engaged in regenerate their own community and in addition to support for small business and social policy we be begin to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community .
the work of this URBAN agenda be then take out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarket and famous British pub .
this be the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in term of communication and publicity .
a regard the specific guideline govern the initiative , they be broadly define to give scope for local and regional diversity .
we agree that they ought to be indicative in nature , allow the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programme .
in committee we be not in favour of reduce the number to 50 .
we be in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 be not the key factor .
instead , we should go for good-quality project that can act a a catalyst to effect change and renewal , to attract inward investment in term of loan and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect .
the Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of area within the financial ceiling of their allocation .
in the designation of local URBAN program we need to make good use of local indicator and statistic on deprivation and health to enable u to more effectively target the most affected area .
in the UK the local index of deprivation be a very good example of a widely use standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programme .
this need to be acknowledge a a tool and resource in addition to the EU criterion .
I would ask you to take on board local indicator to help u do that .
our most deprived urban neighbourhood face a plethora of problem : high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment , poverty and social exclusion .
often these problem be compound by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency .
we therefore have unstable community which be infiltrate with crime , drug-dealing and gang .
this be all too familiar in many of our urban area .
all these complex problem undermine the quality of life for our urban resident , yet we have the potential in these area to create growth and prosperity .
that be why again , in my report , I have ask that action under the URBAN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem : these area do not have single , & quot ; mono & quot ; problem .
instead , community in urban area should be encourage to present integrated action plan to tackle their specific urban problem , use EU resource a a value add to local action .
I would like to see those action extend to cover health and anti-discrimination , a provide for in the Amsterdam Treaty .
the Community initiative mean community involvement .
some of the most active and committed proponent and agent of change in our urban area be local resident .
we need to encourage them to participate in design and deliver project for these programme .
the time-scale therefore propose by the Commission be very ambitious .
it be better to have quality project with the active participation of community group than to have project deliver on time but without local participation .
the Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concern the selection criterion use for the new urban initiative but it must also disclose the consultancy network which be be use to deliver the exchange of good practice .
this be important in the interest of transparency and the overall effectiveness of network .
finally , I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problem face the post-industrial city we require local participation .
we need to deploy the energy of the unemployed , the underused skill of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problem .
we shall thereby be able to replace poverty , dependency and alienation with equity , initiative and participation .
this will help u to restore the credibility of the EU and the confidence of citizen that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problem .
. ( it ) Mr President , a the rapporteur , Mrs McCarthy , have already point out , we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate hold last year on the reform of the regulation .
a we have hear , the objective of URBAN be the promotion of innovative strategy to promote economic and social regeneration in urban area , bearing in mind that 80 % of the population of Europe live in city .
the Communication from the Commission take account of the need to adopt approach combine a range of economic , social , and infrastructural measure .
a the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stress in it opinion , the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergy in this context while avoid duplication of multiple funding .
while , on the one hand , we believe that steer committee should ensure that the various project be coherent and complementary , we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchange of information and coordination between the department involve .
not only be this coordination essential but , a we state in our opinion , exchange and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential .
Mr President , the importance of this initiative be increase constantly a economic and social problem in Europe & apos ; s city intensify and the public feel more and more out of touch with the administration of it city or neighbourhood .
that situation will be compound by social reclassification result from European Union enlargement , and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our city .
address those problem be all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of city into the surround area and in view of the city & apos ; historical and cultural role .
however , in order for such an effort to succeed it be necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public a a whole and to enlist the support of the le active social group and the group particularly affect by the economic and social crisis .
here , we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of woman , and the agency that represent them , in planning and implement the URBAN initiative programme .
a the Committee on Equal Opportunities , we also stress the need to finance infrastructure that will facilitate professional activity by woman , mainly by harmonise their professional and family commitment , and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generation , social solidarity .
effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local level , thus increase it political importance still further since woman need to feel the effect of European policy in their day-to-day life in real term .
Mr President , our committee welcome the priority propose by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local community and ethnic minority and improved security and crime prevention .
in committee we think that it be necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban area to go hand-in-hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minority and therefore for measure design to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programme to be fund by URBAN .
we consider that increase public confidence by combat everyday urban crime be one of the central task of urban regeneration .
we adopt our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it be particularly important to continue URBAN - which in the past have be implement successfully - because , a we see it , program of this kind be the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensure that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful coexistence .
for this reason we very much welcome programme of this kind .
I should like to comment on the concern which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have with regard to the largest of the four Community initiative , INTERREG III .
it must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measure to receive support under INTERREG III .
in the light of the fact that 50 % of unemployment in the Union be essentially structural and give the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border region - I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration - this be not only reasonable but imperative .
the measure eligible for fund list in Annex II of strand A do also seem encourage in this respect .
in reality , however , the Commission communication do not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrate approach for social and employment policy aspect .
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased number of vocational training measure , especially in area with high level of long-term and youth unemployment .
employment policy measure should also be eligible for fund under strand B , especially for the applicant country a part of the pre-accession strategy .
in general where the employment policy measure be concern it would seem to me to be necessary for appointment to the joint cooperation committee to be make on a regional basis - because the local expertise require for these specific purpose be only available at regional level - so a to avoid these measure become too abstract and therefore prove disappointing .
the fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III be - in my opinion - still excessive be something which we can and indeed always must criticise , although it almost seem to me a though this be unavoidable with the Commission & apos ; s support programme .
however , I should like to point out that it be precisely here that this be fatal.It be precisely where employment policy be concern that we should work towards measure which be a simplify a possible so that the social dimension of the EU be once again give the importance which it deserve .
we ask for a guarantee that the decision-making body for the project be represent equally by three element : political representative and public administration , company and economic operator , and social operator , include union and non-governmental organisation .
we would particularly like to stress that there must be balance representation between men and woman in all of these body .
we would also like to stress that the main objective be the promotion of strategy for sustainable development , whose positive effect would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself , and we therefore feel it be appropriate for the project to be integrate into the development programme , include in Objectives 1 and 2 , and into the regional planning of the region and country in which they be locate .
we be pleased that all the rural area of the Union may be involve in LEADER + , but we believe that it be necessary to concentrate Community resource in the less-favoured region in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union , and that state government should not divert these resource towards objectives other than cohesion .
the Committee believe that project finance under action 1 should place value on the potential of endogenous development , in particular base on local tradition , technique and practice , on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy .
the Committee support the Commission proposal to concentrate action in small select area and believe that , give the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited location , the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduce to 10 000 inhabitant .
we believe it be necessary to coordinate the development objective and management mechanism of action 2 and 3 , finance by LEADER , with those of other action finance by other Community programme relate to interregional and international cooperation and partnership , such a INTERREG , SAPAR , PHARE , TACIS and MEDA , in the same area .
Mr President , Mrs Stenzel , lady and gentleman , before address the EQUAL report itself , I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guideline on which the report be base .
the basic objective of an EU-wide employment policy be lay down in the guideline and include employability , entrepreneurship and adaptability .
these objective be obviously intend to make employee a useful and usable a possible to the economy .
however , the aim of an approach which really seek to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people & apos ; s self-determination .
only then do it stop be a question of economic usability and start be about people have equal right to shape their own life .
Mrs Stenzel & apos ; s report have , however , turn out very well , at least where the prescribe guideline be concern .
all asylum seeker and refugee be to be include explicitly in the programme , although this should be self-evident .
nevertheless the Conservatives vote against this in the committee .
I would ask them the following question : do your policy seek to marginalise people ?
what be the idea behind prevent people from work when they wish to do so ?
do this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability ?
it be also worth mention that this be a mainstreaming programme , because there remain a shortcoming in the report .
particular emphasis be give to the point that woman & apos ; s opportunity on the labour market ought to be improve and that to achieve this more crèches should be build .
anyone who let men happily climb the career ladder and worry only about childcare place without fight against the way in which the work of reproduction be share out unevenly have not - and unfortunately that include woman - understand the concept of mainstreaming !
Mr President , lady and gentleman , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism adopt this opinion on the EQUAL report at it conclude discussion with no vote against and one abstention .
I be deliberately state this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there be in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
this cross-group support for the opinion be explain by the conclusion , which be devote to the question of how issue relate to regional policy , transport and tourism can be combine with action to combat all form of discrimination and inequality in connection with the labour market .
that be why a ceiling need to be set for administrative expenditure .
the committee base it conclusion on these critical comment .
we attach particular importance to link the creation of new job for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector , in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprise with promote the establishment of new small and medium-sized business bear in mind the necessary economic structural change .
dovetail the activity under the Community initiative with the European employment initiative be an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attain the objective of the EQUAL programme .
we fully support the innovative approach towards set up development partnership and organise the exchange of experience at European level a an integral part of the EQUAL programme .
the specific target of derive European add value bring the regional cooperation up to European level while retain the cooperation of the various regional operator .
this be a good approach and that be why we have also support it .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I would like to thank the rapporteur , who have manage to produce excellent report in just a short time .
however , criticism have be voice within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee .
the report be late , and , in addition , they be very hastily discuss by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
a good opportunity to discuss the result , good practice and shortcoming of the earlier programme be therefore lose .
our group be keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focus on area outside the European Union .
such important area include the Balkans and the Adriatic region , but , in my opinion , we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either .
our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of fund and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG , TACIS , ISPA and PHARE programme .
this coordination be at present lacking , and the Commission have not a yet make any precise proposal to improve it .
we here in Parliament be wait for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue a soon a possible .
it be of decisive importance to get local business , organisation and other player involve in the practical implementation of programme .
experience show that project of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful .
project have often remain half-finished , and their efficiency have be drain by administration and bureaucracy .
we also have to demand that our partner in cooperation be commit to project and fulfil their share of the agreement .
our group be review a few amendment that be reject by the committee .
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report , in which the rapporteur , in the explanatory statement , have deal admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant a per the Commission & apos ; s guideline .
it will not work a an automatic target , but must be apply in the target area accord to prevail condition .
this be such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusion have to draw .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , INTERREG be one of the most European of all the Structural Funds .
here , project cover only one region or one country will not receive support ; they will have to cover neighbouring region in two or more country .
unfortunately this be only true for part of the money , that be only for the border within the EU .
but it be precisely the region on border with third country which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation .
the regulation pretend that there be one , but there be not .
the fact be that the Commission have not amend the regulation for year , although Parliament have be call for it to do so for some time .
the practical consequence for these region in the immediate future be that support for border area will again be downgrade .
since 1996 , Parliament have be call for a joint fund to be create for cooperation with third country in order to resolve difficulty .
nothing have happen !
the difficulty be once again be allow to persist , to the detriment of the region concern .
Parliament be here renew it call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation , and we look forward to a joint fund be create and to the regulation be amend once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners .
we want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pusher !
Mr President , a third of EU money be invest in fund for all kind of development cause .
accord to my group , this be excellent if , a a result of this , deprivation within region , town and population group be eliminate or if health and the environment improve .
that be a question of solidarity and progress .
but dish out increase amount of money be no guarantee for improved spending .
the local council and region where the money end up have since gain practical experience .
they find it be extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy cause .
anything relate to economic growth and infrastructure usually score quite highly , but social goal and environmental cause often can not count on approval .
since there be great uncertainty surround the way in which rule be interpret , local council and region have now start to enlist the service of expensive bureaux.The task of these expert be to gauge to what extent European Commission official would be prepare to approve plan .
in some case , I get the impression that it be not about solidarity or alleviate the most desperate problem , but about propaganda and upholding vested interest in exchange for the European Union & apos ; s blessing .
it seem that the key goal there have become the construction and painting of propaganda panel advertise the fact that such and such a project have be co-financed by the European Union .
too much money be waste on propaganda and investigation bureau , consultation and control , and a great deal of money end up back in the country where it be collect in the first place .
after the planned accession of new Member States with their 100 million inhabitant , the prosperity level of which be at one third or two third of the average level of the current EU Member States , this squandering will generate even more protest .
in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , the Confederal Group of the European United Left be in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion , Mr Nogueira Román , on LEADER .
he be right to point out that it be not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural area .
if there be a choice between invest in innovation project or inject most of the funding into bring on deprive area , we would opt for the latter a this do the most to benefit equality .
after all , innovation in area that have already grow prosperous be pay dividend even now and take place without European funding .
a second point where we need to focus our attention be the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local council .
the emphasis be on local group in which the authority , non-profit-making organisation and profit-making company join force .
the discussion have centre on the allocation formula to be apply .
in this respect , one of the variant consider be reminiscent of the Dutch polder model , the structurally plan cooperation between government , trade union and employer & apos ; organisation .
let u not forget that election for local council and regional parliament be hold so a to represent the entire population .
so , really , these body should already provide for a balance , and take into account the wish of the union movement and environmental movement in the process .
my group welcome the fact that the union movement and environmental movement be expressly give their own role to play , a their input in society be important in our view .
this could prevent local government that be function in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglect their duty of input from the very start .
but the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicate that , unfortunately , democracy be not fully function yet .
one of the objection be that , due to the restricted role of the elected body , business gain more influence .
a long a the economy do not weigh up the need of all in a democratic way but be more concerned with make a profit for the benefit of a few , it be questionable a to whether democracy function better under the rule of employer than under the rule of local council .
we believe in & apos ; one man , one vote & apos ; more than & apos ; one share , one vote & apos ; .
Mr President , there be economic frontier within the European Union , and the internal market with the free movement of good , person , service and capital be fully operate at this time .
but for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it be important that all region within Europe , of which there be over 100 , can economically compete within this very challenging environment .
some area within the European Union be economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per caput .
there be poor region within the Union which need to be give European assistance to improve the fabric of their economy so that they can compete within the European Union structure .
that be why , when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993 , and 1994 and 1999 , we find such a large proportion of the EU budget be put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund .
there be twin problem that still remain for many region in Europe : firstly , the lack of adequate infrastructure in term of road , water treatment facility and related transport network ; secondly , the need to put in place initiative to combat youth and long-term unemployment , which be a constant social problem in many urban and rural part of Europe .
there must always be a commitment to ensure that we do not only build a Europe of the city alone .
we need to ensure that job creation initiative be in place to promote employment opportunity in the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural part of Europe a well .
the core aspect of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programme , namely , the new INTERREG III initiative , EQUAL and the LEADER + scheme .
between these three programme there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promote cross-border development , combat the problem of long-term unemployment and support rural development scheme .
Mr President , quite a few town and city within the European Union have to contend with deprivation .
the Member States do not always have sufficient mean at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately .
this be why it be useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and , if necessary , give additional support under URBAN .
over the next seven year , the Commission & apos ; s proposal concern URBAN will entail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of area stand to benefit .
in common with Mrs McCarthy , I have to note that the number of area have be drastically reduce .
it be desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of project themselves within the confines of a certain budget .
a far a the budget be concern , a already state , URBAN be there to support and complement national policy .
in order to generate extra mean if necessary , I think it be entirely logical to turn first to the Member States and private investor .
consequently , we can not support Amendment No 2 of the Greens , a borne out in the committee meeting .
in addition , I be of the opinion that fund for a town or neighbourhood , especially where Community contribution be concerned , should incentivise .
Structural support be say to cause subsidy-dependence .
we would then be overreach ourselves .
I would like to finish off by make a general comment on INTERREG .
in my opinion , fund for cross-border initiative should only be provide if it be actually require by the region .
when project be implement , it be also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation .
accord to the report issue by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998 , this be not an imagined risk .
hence our amendment in order to prevent contradiction between general policy and actual project .
before I begin I will take the liberty of express my consternation at the way in which Austria have be prejudge by 14 Council representative .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , a part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiative be be prune to a total of four .
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it have be accord .
however , the delayed presentation of the draft guideline have cause a number of problem .
the region have not be sufficiently involve in the preparation of the guideline , although this demand be often make in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds .
there be no direct transition between INTERREG II and III , the practical consequence of which be uncertainty in term of planning and gap in funding .
that be a shame because it threaten perfectly sensible project .
when INTERREG be implement , it will need to be coordinate and synchronise with the other financial instrument concern .
this be particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the fund deploy .
however , problem will arise in particular from the fact that under PHARE , for example , fund be manage on an annual basis and allocation of appropriation be project-related , whereas INTERREG fund be multiannual and be allocate on a measures-related basis .
this will cause practical problem in the future , and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effectively .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , the Community initiative LEADER prove itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative development and pilot project both within and outside rural area .
the preservation of this Community initiative in particular , in the form of a new version - LEADER + - be therefore greatly to be welcome .
the new LEADER + programme now cover all rural area in the European Union , which will open up greater possibility for potential project .
it be important for there to be coordination between LEADER + and the other support initiative in the European Union , but coordination with other national support scheme be also just a important .
overlap between support scheme must be avoid and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effect .
in this context the aim of step up network between eligible zone under LEADER be very welcome .
agriculture be one of the cornerstone of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative .
in the same way , through the LEADER initiative , structural change in agriculture can be support by create new job in rural area .
attention must be pay in the LEADER + programme to all the sector of the economy in rural area ; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result .
LEADER must now move into the implementation phase .
the operational programme need to be approve a quickly a possible by the Commission , which imply practical and efficient administration of application and completion of the application approval process a quickly a possible .
five month be provide for this .
that seem to me to be rather too long .
effort should be make here to achieve shorter time .
because anyone who develop a project and have it ready will also want to start implement it a soon a possible .
despite all the delight over the reworking of this Community initiative LEADER + , I do still have one further concern .
in it proposal the Commission call for an observatory for the LEADER + programme without go into detail on how this proposal would be implement .
for me this raise the following question : who will work there ?
how will these people be select ?
where , above all , will the required money come from , and where should this observatory be locate ?
I do think , though , that the LEADER + programme have not get a penny to spare on additional administrative task , which in the normal course of event would have to be carry out by the Commission in any case .
in addition , experience from other field where observatory have be set up show that , apart from rather dubiously create job , they be not of any great benefit .
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil it monitoring duty directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LEADER + programme run smoothly .
assessment and publication be part of this , and it have of course assume responsibility for these in the past .
Mr President , the majority of the border , which have divide Europe for century , be artificially create , separate single geographic space and create serious disparity in term of balance development and cohesion .
our internal border , or what remain of them , no longer cause war , but they do continue to generate economic backwardness , social barrier and a lack of cultural communication between the people of Europe .
the Community & apos ; s institution be oblige to work towards overcome these border scar , which contradict the spirit of European unity .
the economic and social cohesion which we propose be base , by mean of the INTERREG initiative , on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border area and the outermost region of our continent .
INTERREG have always be at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory .
although the European Parliament support this initiative , our only regret be that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have see any evaluation of INTERREG II .
however , we be aware that we must not delay this third version further , since otherwise we would be jeopardise the success of various project and the continuity of the project which be currently underway.The success of INTERREG be clear and that be the opinion of the local , regional and national authority which have participate in the cofinanced project .
the people who have participate in this initiative have learn the importance of learn together , of innovation , of share project and good practice and of understanding and tolerate each other .
there be many interesting question relate to it , the monitoring centre , the principle of concentration etc.However , I would like to concentrate on the management body .
we must create joint , interregional and transnational management body , in which all local and regional authority , a well a economic and social operator , play an active role .
there must not be any repetition of case of parallel project on both side of a border .
we must create a cross-border culture , and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation , imaginatively overcome exist barrier and overcome the difficulty pose by the differing level of competence in each Member State , in each region and each municipality .
a project must never fail to be implement a a result of difficulty in communication .
during debate in committee , we have also point out the difficulty involve in coordinate INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instrument , such a MEDA , TACIS or PHARE .
this Parliament & apos ; s motion for a resolution have be very attentive to these difficulty , make proposal capable of solve them to the Commission and set reasonable deadline for make the necessary change .
Mr President , my reason for want to contribute to this debate be because the URBAN initiative , in Ireland in particular , have be quite successful and I be keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area .
it be a sad fact that there be many hundred , if not thousand , of community in the European Union suffer very severe poverty and disadvantage .
even in Member States and city that be extremely wealthy we have large number of people live in ghetto , in situation where there be inadequate facility , where schooling be very poor , where the physical infrastructure be under-developed and where drug and other phenomenon be rife .
it seem to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it have a role in help the citizen of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union work for these citizen and their family .
the programme have be extremely successful in Ireland , a indeed I know it have be successful in other country .
it be quite slow in get off the ground there , but it be slow because it be necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programme .
it be important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in develop this initiative .
it would be very easy to have these programme develop quickly and on time if you bring in outside professional expert but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme .
I should like to make one further point before I conclude : we should insist where this money be be allocate and where this programme be be develop that it be do in the context of a serious URBAN development policy .
this , unfortunately , be not the case in Ireland .
I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrate discriminated group into the labour market .
the development partnership be a very clever idea , even though they be experimental .
I have two major concern , however , about the development partnership .
they should be accessible to smaller group , accessible for them to be able to devise , implement and monitor the programme .
we need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme .
I have also express concern in the past about the use of simple language and not use jargon , so that it become accessible to everyone .
I be glad to see that this be accept into the report , but I can not agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really be not express in simple language at all .
my second concern be that some discriminate group have specific problem , for example , disabled people & apos ; s access to the workplace .
project should also specifically address this problem .
these concern must be look at while set up the programme .
I certainly intend to do that with organisation and group in my constituency in the West Midlands .
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugee .
although I be not in favour of those refugee who have be refuse refugee status and threaten with repatriation , have access to EQUAL , I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugee .
it be only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way a everyone else .
thank you , Mr President.Ladies and gentleman , with the LEADER report , rural development be very much to the fore .
this do not happen all that often and it be gratify , especially a the LEADER programme have be key element in the Union & apos ; s rural development policy .
it must be point out that these programme have not only be instrumental in structure regional planning , but have also be vital instrument for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable area such a , for example , area experience depopulation .
it must be stress that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme , local operator have combine force , debate and prepared project .
these programme have , therefore , be important channel for participative democracy , the rationale of the citizen for Europe .
so , the concept for LEADER + should retain all the positive aspect of previous programme .
one urgent question be therefore raise : why , when this programme have be successfully run for ten year , be LEADER + still class a experimental ?
be there so many other European scheme which can boast 800 specific original experiment which be particularly successful ?
for how much longer be the Commission go to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bring it online a part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development ?
moreover , I wonder at the reduced guideline to which the Commission wish to restrict LEADER + .
at a time when , Commissioner , after Seattle , we Europeans be fight on the ground of multifunctionality in rural development project , why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criterion with resource that be far from sufficient ?
a an ecologist , let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approach .
in this connection , the Commission be propose to limit yet further the cooperation action of local action group to only candidate country .
a better solution would be , a indeed the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism suggest , strengthen coordination between LEADER + and the Community cooperation and partnership programme , such a INTERREG , PHARE , SAPARD or MEDA .
the fact be , show solidarity with Eastern Europe , be all very well , but it be not enough .
the tradition which have already be establish by the previous programme with the country of the south , particularly the country around the Mediterranean , must not be abandon .
therefore , once more , we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really need be codecision.Codecision would give u effective mean to progress programme of this type , which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application .
Mr President , I have a few very brief comment .
we be debate the planning phase and guideline for the four Community initiative without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period.This be not very good at all .
programme and objective usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their result be not always satisfactory , while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plan often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud .
the Community initiatives we be debate could play a positive part subject to certain precondition .
they must , however , not be subordinate to the objective and aspiration of a more generally negative economic and social policy , but must develop their own self-sufficient role .
for example , adapt EQUAL to the objective of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relation transform this initiative into a new version of local employment contract .
extend the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union entail the risk of marginalise deprive area even more , to the benefit of more developed area .
the INTERREG initiative must include eligible area with special emphasis on border area , island and both mountain and non-mountain area , such a the prefecture of Arta in Greece , whose omission from Annex I of the Commission & apos ; s communication be ill-considered .
Mr President , rural development have be identify by this Parliament and the Commission a a priority policy area , and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible , Commissioner Fischler .
our response to rural decline have come late in the day , but I suppose better late than never .
family farming be now recognise a central to the European agricultural model and be an objective to be address , certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000 .
in my view the next five year will decide the future of thousand of marginal family farm .
it behove all of u to do everything possible to ensure their survival .
a the Commissioner know , farm alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural community .
for this reason we need the coordination of all policy area capable of impact positively on rural development .
in this regard LEADER have establish itself a an effective development initiative .
it provide the opportunity for local community to identify their development potential and become actively involve in address those problem .
the voluntary participation of people in development programme be something that be not always fully appreciate .
yet , through LEADER , there can be no doubt it effectiveness a an integral part of broader EU and national policy .
in conclusion , while welcome Commission approval for LEADER + , I be concern about the time delay between the end of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme .
I urge you to look seriously at this problem .
a break in continuity will have serious consequence for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional worker .
I should further like to express major reservation with regard to the exaggerated tendency which , in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B , involve associate environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000 , which I think be often an excessively abstract mean of safeguard ecosystem , from which user be in danger of be exclude or severely restrict .
finally , if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit , I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be give more information on the procedure relate to the implementation of the INTERREG project and , beyond that , of similar initiative .
it would be even better if they be involve to a greater extent in the process of framing and implement the programme concern , otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authority and even the citizen .
Mr President , first of all , I would like thank the rapporteur of the EQUAL report , Mrs Stenzel , very warmly for all the effort she have make to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of u .
EQUAL be a very difficult programme because it attempt to combine so many old programme and yet aim to view them in a different light , do so with le money than be available in the previous fund .
this be an arduous task .
only , the number of people affect by these programme have not really drop .
this be why it be so hard to strike a balance , not only between the different country or the different component , but especially between the different group list in the programme , and in fact this be what have preoccupy u to date .
comment be make here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another .
I , for my part , have focus on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme , and I have to say that their position could well have be overlook altogether if it have not be for the European Parliament devote special attention to them .
although a few other group have be mention , it be the Member States , in particular , which be on the lookout .
for example , I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component , namely refugee .
I would , therefore , ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance be strike between these different group .
it should not be the case that one Member State , under the pretext of call on the subsidiarity principle , can decide that all funding should go to one group .
I think that this will have to be monitor closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which Mr Meijer have warn u so vehemently , to wit , that vested interest will emerge and that people will think that the money be theirs to spend .
this be not the case !
it have to be redistribute time and again .
it should be use for innovative project and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister & apos ; s treasury fund .
that be not the intention and that be an important point that we need to bear in mind here .
I believe that the remain problem that we have face within this Parliament , and which in large part stem from the fact that it be so difficult to strike the right balance , can be solve .
a far a the Commission be concern , I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that be be conclude here in this Parliament , mainly with a view to reach a balance .
I would just like to underline this - the situation be , of course , a little precarious - Parliament have , for the sake of convenience and safety , place the EQUAL programme on the back burner for the time be , so that Parliament have yet to be persuade of the way the fund be to be distribute .
I believe that this be actually a good thing .
the position of Parliament in this whole procedure be somewhat unclear .
the Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that be exactly why this back burner be extremely useful .
Mr President , there be no doubt that the INTERREG initiative promotes effort to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union .
however , I should like to stress INTERREG & apos ; s particular importance for the Balkan area , where political development and hostility over the past few year have have major economic repercussion for neighbour country and especially for my own country , Greece , which be the only Member State on that long-suffering peninsula .
for Greece , for the neighbouring country Italy and Austria , but also for Europe a a whole , the social and economic restoration of the Balkans , bring political stability , be a vitally important matter .
so far , some Balkan country have receive aid from the PHARE and Obnova programme , while others have not .
during the new programme period , in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding have be provide for from new financial instrument and regulation , such a ISPA and Sapard , it be consider absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strand of INTERREG with other financial aid to third country .
accordingly , we welcome the related reference in Chapter 7 of the European Commission & apos ; s propose general guideline for INTERREG .
the effort to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programme equally , and I say that because in the MEDA programme during the last period some problem arise which have to be overcome , so that we can have equal treatment for all the third country participate in that programme .
I should like to end by say that the planning of the new inter-state cooperation zone have take no account of the Mediterranean & apos ; s geographical peculiarity , which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island region .
we therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone plan next come up for review .
I end by stress the need for the European Union to persist with such initiative , which strive to eliminate inequality between our region , and to foster their harmonious development .
and since this be St. Valentine & apos ; s day , a a former Mayor of a regional city , I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European region which need that love .
Mr President , Commissioner Fischler , rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angle : preservation of job , stewardship of the countryside and , not least , local culture , because that be of the utmost importance .
only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assure .
we can observe the consequence of migration from the countryside in several area of the Alps and they be devastate .
but I warn against use these programme to take urban culture to the countryside .
and neither should we create structure which be reliant on subsidy and which will be dependent on them forevermore .
to really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which have , since it gain new currency , become relatively devoid of meaning , but we all know what we mean by it - what be need , amongst other thing , be an integrated approach in the countryside towards , for example , tourism and agriculture .
the investment need to be visionary .
young , creative individual must be make to feel an attachment to the countryside.If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more .
none of u think much of the principle of indiscriminate , all-round distribution , and the pilot project need to act , a it be , like avalanche and trigger other similar project .
I would be in favour of support self-contained cycle of project and , even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have have shortcoming here and there , overall they be certainly positive .
I should like to ask that we consider grant derogation not only in the Nordic country but also for mountainous area - the Alps , the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada , from where I have just return - in respect of population size and density .
Mr President , I want to talk about the EQUAL report , especially the issue of the policy on refugee .
last week , we have a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government .
today , we be already discuss the Austrian coalition government & apos ; s policy on refugee because Mrs Stenzel , who be the author of the EQUAL report , of course represent Austria & apos ; s govern conservative party and it policy .
the most startling aspect of her original report be that she want to limit aid to the small group of refugee cover by the Geneva Convention , that be to say so-called quota refugee or UN refugee .
in actual fact , it be the other refugee , namely those outside the quota and those not cover by UN aid , who need aid the most .
the Committee reject this discriminatory proposal and decide that all refugee should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical condition .
some member of the Committee , however , support Mrs Stenzel & apos ; s proposal and wording .
a I see it , this mean that Mr Haider & apos ; s politics be already cast their shadow over this Parliament .
it be therefore crucially important that the Chamber should be a emphatic a it possibly can be in establish the fact that all refugee be to have a place on the EQUAL programme .
I want , finally , to say that I have certain misgiving last week when we discuss the formation of the Austrian Government but , when it come to discuss and criticise it policy on refugee , I have no misgiving .
I hope that the Chamber will be just a commit this time .
Mr President , during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999 , when there be 13 different initiative in operation , the INTERREG II cross-border programme be an important initiative .
the fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 include the INTERREG initiative be I believe , a very clear indication of the importance which be attach to it by national EU Member States .
the INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have prove an absolute success in term of bridge closer social and economic development between border Member States .
come from the border county in the north-west of Ireland , I have see over the year the important role which INTERREG I and II have play and I be delight to welcome INTERREG III .
the Commission be allocate 67 million pound towards the INTERREG III programme , which will be spend on continue the development of cross-border economic project between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
the European Union have play a key role in develop the border county region in Ireland over the year .
the European Union be the single largest contributor , with 80 million pound to the International Fund for Ireland .
the European Union contribute 75 % of the Peace and Reconciliation programme .
all in all , INTERREG , the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all play an important role in the develop peace process .
Mr President , I be take the floor to speak about INTERREG , but I shall confine myself to a few criticism , which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time .
we have all speak favourably of this programme & apos ; s confirmation and of the extension of the sector it cover to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation , in addition to cross-border cooperation .
however , this do not blind u to the fact that the majority of resource - 50-80 % - will be reserve for cross-border cooperation , for INTERREG IIIA.Therefore , we still think the decision to consolidate the current area of cooperation in this strand , regard the selection of eligible region , be wrong and contradictory .
we hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament & apos ; s position in practical term , and not just with a formal tribute .
cross-border cooperation continue almost exclusively to be an issue concern landlocked area and , where exception have be make for maritime area , their selection be not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policy .
this discrimination be much more serious for island that have a regional status that can only be link to area of an exclusively maritime nature .
this be in line with ongoing discrimination , which ignore Article 158 of the Treaty on island region with regard to cohesion policy .
more serious still be the fact that this be occur while ignore the new situation associate with the approach that have be adopt towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of region such a Malta .
this have give rise to the proposal we be make to at least extend the region eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian province which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the region of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan region .
for a long time , probably a survival of our colonial heritage , our region have fix their attention on the European mainland , ignoring and even scorn their closest neighbour .
that time be now past .
our region have become aware of belong to an environment that they be connect to , not only in geographical term but also in term of their culture and the history of their people , hence the intensely express aspiration to become more deeply root in this environment .
this increase awareness do not , however , affect identity alone .
it be foster by a fair appraisal of our asset .
so , for example , the island of Réunion be locate on a trade axis between the country of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia .
it can not afford to remain outside the regional alliance be forge in this area , lest it miss out on a historic opportunity , and the same applies to our region in the Caribbean .
at last we be convince that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment , the source of so much despair , if we can export to neighbour country the know-how which we have gain thanks to the operation of the European structural fund .
INTERREG appropriation may be use to make our region into veritable European Union bridgehead into these geographical area , give it worldwide scope .
I be count on the Commission , and specifically on you , Commissioner , to allocate adequate resource for effective action .
Mr President , Commissioners , I greatly welcome the possibility for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG , but my concern be that the proposal offer fewer opportunity in this respect for maritime than for other area .
I understand the Commission & apos ; s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation .
nonetheless , there be many maritime area between which link be already establish .
various local authority around the North Sea provide a prime example of this .
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation .
in consequence , I seek some small adjustment to the guideline to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the way in which the interest of maritime area can fall between strand A and strand B . These adjustment include clarify the possibility for cooperation between maritime area and permit greater development of practical and visible project , particularly those of an infrastructural kind .
such measure will put maritime and insular area on an equal footing with other area of the EU .
I hope for their adoption .
Mr President , our group welcome the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that , if you be a British Muslim physically disable in some way you no longer have to choose which category of discrimination you belong to a a target group : you can use your expertise and experience to solve problem , rather than be define a the problem .
there be a lot of expertise within the relevant organisation which deserve to be share .
we also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tighten up of the transnational level .
we be concern , therefore , a others have say , at the number of amendment which seek to exclude even further some of society & apos ; s most exclude , by aim for a very narrow definition of & quot ; refugee & quot ; .
my group will not be support those amendment .
we be also concern at the number of amendment which , in seek to introduce greater flexibility , run the risk perhaps of obscure responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative .
Mr President , I be very pleased to see URBAN orientate towards a more integrated approach which attempt to solve interrelated problem .
yet , there be some risk of dilution of effort.If we pursue too many objective , our overall effectiveness suffers .
of course , every instance of a deprived urban area be a separate case .
but there be a common factor , a hard core , comprise unemployment , the resignation or withdrawal of public service and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprise , both commercial and other kind .
I would wish URBAN to be orientate mainly towards provide answer to those cause of urban deprivation .
for this , of course , central policy must interact and be coordinate with development policy , so that the latter too can be reorientate and can work synergistically with the objective of any URBAN programme implement in our country , and so that it be not just use them a an alibi for it own shortcoming .
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , I shall confine my observation to Mr Decourrière & apos ; s report .
the INTERREG Community Initiative Programme be an extremely important tool in term of the development and regional planning of European territory , most particularly with reference to effectively take into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and it outlying region .
INTERREG must , therefore , be an instrument promote territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory .
it be obvious to me that the regional and local authority , and their representative body , the Committee of the Regions and , of course , the European Parliament should have be involve in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity frame this programme .
indeed , I be force to observe that this be not the case when the Commission draw up it communication , publish on 13 October last year .
even though I approve of the general guideline of INTERREG III , I feel it be extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme , finance by the ERDF , and the other external cooperation fund , include in particular the European Development Fund , intend for ACP country .
in this connection , I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism for adopt one of my amendment add the EDF to the list of these fund .
the most remote region , particularly the four French overseas department , must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund , in turn , cooperation project with their ACP neighbour in their respective geographical area .
furthermore , I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunity that have be offer to the most remote and island region accord to the guideline put forward in the communication .
it be essential for these region to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III , just like all the other region in the Union , especially now that the REGIS programme dedicate to such isolated region have be drop .
finally , in conclusion , I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocate to strand C , for interregional cooperation , even though the added value this offer the Community be undeniable .
Mr President , my start point be the EQUAL report and equality between men and woman , although I must admit that it be sometimes hard to talk about this issue , which have a feeling of déjà vu about it when you be my age , in any case .
unfortunately , it be necessary to point out again that we do not have equality .
a breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to change in other area , however .
for me , equality certainly do not mean that both party to a marriage work the whole time and hand the child over to a nanny , alias an immigrant who have not have the opportunity to obtain another job .
if that be the case , we have not progress one little bit since pagan time .
no , equality mean that we all participate in both working life and family life .
unfortunately , development be not move in that direction .
on the contrary .
I think , therefore , that paragraph 7 contains something very central , i.e . that EQUAL will be use a a testing ground for develop and promote new way of deliver employment policy .
one can only hope that it succeed .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , those who work on rural area know that , of the programme which the European Union have manage , the LEADER programme , both LEADER I and LEADER II , be one of it success story , and I hope that the same will be true of LEADER + .
one of the reason why it have be so successful be that the basic concept of the LEADER programme arouse substantial interest in activity amongst the population concern .
I be glad that LEADER + be to remain true to this underlie concept .
there be a problem , however , which we need to address together .
because LEADER be a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach , a huge number of idea have come to fruition in recent year through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or a successful a they once be .
and because of the programme & apos ; s success and it basic approach they will of course at some point then be drop from LEADER .
that be why , where the good LEADER project be concerned , we need to ensure that those which have prove to be outstanding be not suddenly discontinue ; instead the idea which have prove to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transfer into the standard programme a a reliable , positive component of our support to rural area .
of course this be also the basic idea .
it be to take new idea and try them out in LEADER , with the participant on the ground , with the local organisation on the ground , with many non-governmental organisation , with the church , with all those who have help actually to get new idea up and run in rural community .
here we must ensure that the good scheme , those which be really excellent , be then somehow transfer into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work .
my request to the Commission be that it should make sure that the organisation and section of the population which get involve really be accept .
there should be no attempt to have one or other organisation , which be just be form with a view to contribute a new idea and be not yet so well know , push a little on to the sideline , say because of official local or regional policy .
have faith in the successful result which LEADER have have so far .
at the begin it be sometimes a little like chase a rainbow if we say that a plan be too idealistic .
and then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy , include ourselves at this level , could never have imagine would suddenly have develop so well .
that be the charm of LEADER , and that should please not be lose !
Mr President , I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which highlight the need to distinguish between action to combat discrimination against woman and action to combat discrimination against minority group .
woman be not a minority and often suffer double discrimination a member of minority group a well a because of their gender .
this be why specific action for woman be need , a well a mainstreaming .
the report address this and propose integrate action to achieve equality between woman and men in all aspect of work ; it also recognise the importance of work with local and regional body which be those closest to the people to help ensure that all project result be mainstreamed .
the involvement of voluntary and community group will also be an essential ingredient of the EQUAL initiative and the project .
the development partnership within the thematic field , which be refer to in Amendment No . 22 , would enable even the smaller organisation to play a part in the EQUAL initiative .
my group will be support Amendment No . 22 .
Mr President , the report under discussion in the House today be doubtless of great importance .
in addition to the objective it be work towards , the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the 2000-2006 programming period lie in it added value from the viewpoint of what be now the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean country .
in my opinion , it be precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparity between region and put an end to the isolation of border area .
indeed , these area - and it be right to stress this - have an important role to play a an interface with the applicant country that be go to join the Union .
it be precisely with this in mind that I table some amendment which I consider to be of the utmost importance , and that the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism have subsequently take up .
they call for the area eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extend to all region of the Adriatic , a well a to the Sicilian province which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which , inexplicably , be not currently include in strand A , Annex 1 .
I be confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament & apos ; s position on the matter , in accordance with the Code of Conduct .
there be fundamental advantage for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant country and to support border region .
finally , it be to be hop that greater coordination will be seek between the INTERREG initiative and the exist Community programme , which be significant for external policy , a a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programme .
Mr President , Commissioners , lady and gentleman , LEADER I be an outright success due , in particular , to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operator .
it be , I think , regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II , regard the quality of the project , the quantity of appropriation spent and , most especially , the demotivation of some local operator in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encounter .
I be pleased to see , however , that under LEADER + , new resource have be allocate to help rural territory to develop their potential and to implement the objective of local and sustainable development .
I feel it be important to put special emphasis on try out new way to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment , in order to promote employment .
the time be now right , I think , to consider include the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation .
it be interest to note that all rural area may be eligible for LEADER II .
nonetheless , if the opportunity for Member States to determine the area , within the scope of this initiative , remain available , then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resource and prioritise project in the le prosperous area .
there must , of course , be transparency regard the selection criterion for project and local action group .
I also feel there be ground for ensure , in particular , that the financial channel of States or local authority be not behind the delay in payment which may have cause some LAGs to become bankrupt under LEADER II .
Mr President , a a Member from one of the outermost region , I must point out that this be a very special afternoon a far a regional policy be concern , because of the debate on two Community initiative , URBAN and INTERREG .
I would like to remind you that these initiative be aim , firstly , in the case of URBAN , at improve the quality of life of the citizen who live in the poorer part of various European city , and , in the case of INTERREG , at facilitate cohesion and recognise the diversity and potential of the region of the European Union , particularly by include the outermost region in strand B and C .
like the rapporteur , we deplore the fact that it have be exclude from strand IIIA .
with regard to INTERREG , we be very happy that there be a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concern with cooperation .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , particularly Mr Decourrière , for his sensitivity towards the region and for accept our amendment .
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we be make .
Mr President , with regard to the various initiative which we be analyse this afternoon , I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them , that be , the URBAN programme .
it be a fact that we be debate this programme today because the European Parliament insist that this initiative should be maintain .
the Commission propose remove it and other initiative , but Parliament & apos ; s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time lead to the URBAN initiative be retain .
I believe that we should be please about this .
but what be the Commission & apos ; s argument , from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular , for eliminate the URBAN programme ?
it argument be one of priority .
the urban question be so important that we can not tighten our belt and undervalue it with a programme which have such a small budget .
today the programme be in place and therefore I believe we have achieve something important , that distinguish mark of the European Union call the URBAN programme .
however , I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General , because I think they be absolutely right .
the urban dimension must be incorporate much more deeply in all the structural fund .
therefore , I do not believe I need to restate the number of factor which demand this investment in urban area , factor which be on the agenda , and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect .
organisation of disabled people and disabled people & apos ; s non-disabled representative must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making .
that be why this Parliament have put forward paragraph 10 and 15 of the resolution , to ensure that Member States can not ignore any one target group .
disabled people have too often be leave off the list .
because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves a a linguistic minority deny respect for their own language and culture - it be necessary a state in paragraph 9 to enable some partnership to be define which be specific to a particular disability or other group .
EQUAL remain crucial also to region like my own , in the east of England , outside the principal fund of Objective I . We have have an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response .
former ADAPT project range from the CORE project , which have develop new supply chain for the car industry in Bedfordshire , to project to raise standard in small business in Hertfordshire in Essex .
we have see the NOW project help 70 woman to return to work in Suffolk , many of whom be able to come and share the result of their experience directly with u at the European Parliament in Brussels .
EQUAL remain important to u because it be precisely in relatively more prosperous region that lower-skilled job be be shed , which can be an important first destination for those discriminate against in the labour market .
finally , a word on INTERREG .
it really be quite nonsensical that partnership set up in 1994 be be roll over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional link .
during this period the port of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launch significant new transportation and economic link with partner in the Netherlands .
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2 , which would ensure flexibility so a to include new area , particularly on maritime border .
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , for the information of the House , Mr President , I should like to make a clarification .
Chancellor Schüssel & apos ; s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government lead by Chancellor Klima .
there be no change in refugee policy in Austria !
rural area make up over 80 % of the EU & apos ; s territory and 25 % of the population live in them .
a a farmer and Member of Parliament , I have always endeavour not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural area a a whole .
I attach particular importance to adopt an integrate approach towards rural development because I be convince that only cooperation link up all people from all walk of life in rural area will permit them to be active and attractive place to live for everyone ;
I refer , in short , to the multifunctionality of rural area .
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER + programme because of it comprehensive nature .
in the future it will be possible to have programme not only in the individual zone eligible for structural aid but in all the region of the EU .
this across-the-board approach be sensible because the programme for rural development be also structure in this way .
in the future , funding will no longer come from three fund but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone .
it will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programme because the EAGGF be suppose to be an effective financial instrument .
greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness , because the money should not be squander recklessly .
in addition , I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offer an approach towards create an integrate and environmentally friendly development strategy .
there be great potential for future job creation in rural area here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospect to people live in the countryside .
that be why policy for rural area be more than a policy just for farmer .
LEADER + should supplement already exist programme , avoid overlap and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which be a comprehensive a possible .
in this way , LEADER + can , together with the programme under Regulation ( EC ) No 1257 / 99 , consolidate the second pillar of the CAP even more effectively and produce the best possible benefit for the whole of the countryside .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I be not always proud of the fuss that go on here in Parliament , but the URBAN programme be one of the best example of our work : it be create follow an initiative in Parliament .
the Commission would have abolish URBAN , but this time Parliament draw the longer straw .
it be good that URBAN be to continue , a it have have good result at local level .
the problem in Europe & apos ; s urban area be get worse ; fortunately , we now have consensus with the Commission .
the majority of the population of Europe live in city , and their problem be among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matter in themselves .
there be an immense risk of exclusion .
in many city in France and England there be now slum , breed ground for many sort of problem .
none of u want South American type favelas in Europe .
we have to act now , before it be too late .
our city be also of decisive importance for Europe & apos ; s economy .
we always come back to the same basic problem in Europe : our economy do not support the individual sufficiently , nor be it sufficiently dynamic .
the economy have to be strong for u to be able to attend to the problem of our fellow-citizens and our environment .
this be not policy ; it be life & apos ; s simple logic .
it be good that spending have become focused , a otherwise the buckshot get scatter to the four wind .
now we have to concentrate on solve problem in small and middle-size town and city , a they do not have enough resource .
in this way we will also be able to speed up matter in surround rural area ; it be often forget that urban and rural problem in fact go hand in hand .
the basis for all this be that we should be encourage individual innovation and entrepreneurship , a group action begin by the individual will help revitalise an area internally .
grant fund without an economy that can stand on it own two foot be like carry water to fill up a dry well : there will be enough to drink for a while , but tomorrow the well will be dry again .
Mr President , with the implementation of INTERREG III , European cooperation policy be enter a new phase .
our attention be no longer focus exclusively on internal border but also on external one .
in the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation , the European Union need instrument that will allow it to strengthen it link and communication channel with neighbouring region , particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe .
the Union & apos ; s border must no longer be an obstacle to balance development , but - on the contrary - an opportunity , a bridge to more fruitful cooperation .
by mean of amendment adopt in committee , Parliament have try to supplement the Commission & apos ; s work , by include new element in the list of area target for aid , and in particular external border area and maritime border area in Southern Europe .
in it draft guideline , the Commission acknowledge that these border require greater attention than they do in the past .
this be on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean country .
a President Prodi too mention when outline the strategic objective for the period 2000-2005 , boost the Barcelona process be a priority for the Union , and the INTERREG III initiative will be able to make it contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective .
Mr President , from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion be available for the Structural Funds , but only 5 ¾ % be set aside for the Community initiative , INTERREG , LEADER , URBAN and EQUAL .
that be a reduction of 3 ¾ % compare with the previous CIs .
no more than EUR 2.8 billion be provide for EQUAL , a Mrs Stenzel & apos ; s balance report make clear .
this make the large number of amendment and far too long a wish list of possible task all the more astonishing .
how be priority suppose to be set here ?
there be agreement on the principle that marginalisation , discrimination and inequality on the labour market should be reduce .
transnational strategy be intend to make it possible for disadvantaged group to have access to job .
I have no sympathy for amendment once again back the TAOs.Criticism of the previous Commission & apos ; s work be particularly severe , legitimately so , with regard to these Technical Assistance Offices .
our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs be , after all , in overall charge of analyse considerable shortcoming and failure to carry out check in case relate to LEONARDO .
the Commission can not therefore be relieve of direct responsibility or the task of carry out inspection under EQUAL either .
the Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promote ability to work and quality of work , of the assessment of result and of the effective communication of best practice .
only then will it be possible for the desire multiplier effect to be achieve .
Mr President , I want to refer to the Commission proposal on the budget line to promote the CAP .
on 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopt a proposal to ensure that a legal basis be give to the budget line inform the public about the CAP .
this proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382 .
action which promote understand between young farmer and the EU and also create stronger link with EU candidate country and the outside world be important .
therefore I be put forward these amendment to Parliament to give it support to the contribution of this type of programme .
give the need to encourage young farmer to continue in farm it be vitally important that they be well-informed about development in the common agricultural policy .
informing and training young farmer at European level be vitally important .
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrate on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmer .
regard information and training , in the past this budget line have be allocate for information , communication and training .
but the Commission be now propose that training should no longer be include .
I feel that training should be include where it provide relevant information at European level about the CAP .
such European training be one element in ensure that young farmer have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decision for the future .
therefore I be put forward three amendment .
I would urge Parliament to support them .
Mr President , I be take the floor to express my opinion , drawn from my experience of municipal administration , that the URBAN project should , or rather must , have a threefold purpose : firstly , to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic , old and perhaps dilapidate area of city .
secondly , to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centre , within these old quarter of our city .
there be little point in have street which be now wonderfully lit , with new pavement , with newly pave road surface , all whitewash and beautiful , if we be not able to fill them with activity and , therefore , employment .
I would like to make it clear that it be not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operator , but rather also of select those project which be aim at employment , or to put it another way , project which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of job .
thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the project should principally be aim at the complete rehabilitation of people and family , because man be not make for the law , but rather law be make for man .
these area of our city be often home to single-parent family , elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity , and family face difficulty ; sometimes they be family which have break down and which be exclude from mainstream society .
these people live in area which should benefit from these project .
if we have success in this threefold sense , I believe that these family , these people , these European citizen , will believe more in Europe , and this seem to me to be very important because , ultimately , the city will increasingly come to play a leading role in European life .
. ( FR ) Mr President , before my friend and fellow Commissioners , Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou , in turn come to speak - since all three of u who be responsible for these four Community initiative have have the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest , I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG , which many of you have bring up and discuss .
straight away I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur from the committee , from all the committee , but also to the speaker for the group and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speech and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiative .
I be mindful of the fact that it be in fact the European Parliament which make the political decision and support the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban area in difficulty , in favour of sustainable urban development , involve at the same time this integrate approach , which we value , to handle the economic , social and environmental aspect simultaneously .
have mention the fundamental point of agreement between the Commission & apos ; s proposal and Parliament and , have stress my great interest in hear the various contribution , I should like to answer a few of the criticism and a few of the suggestion which have be make , with apology if I can not attribute each of the question to the speaker by name .
I think however that you will all recognise your own comment .
firstly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the maximum threshold of fifty town , which a number of you term arbitrary .
I can understand your concern .
that be my initial response to the threshold question .
regard a second matter , now , relate to the additional criterion , which should be take into consideration in select disadvantage areas.Here , too , I be willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criterion in addition to the Community criterion give in point 11 of the guidance project .
third point : specific measure in favour of some social group - some speaker mention them - woman , but also immigrant and refugee , must be envisage .
this concern , lady and gentleman , lie at the very heart of our URBAN initiative , and I be willing to rewrite the text , if necessary , in order to make this message clearer yet .
regard URBAN , I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention , first of all , the selection procedure .
some speaker want it to be le bureaucratic , more transparent , and to avoid redundancy in term of the project and funding .
lady and gentleman , on this point we must make it clear : in the context of subsidiarity , the selection of zone or municipality eligible for URBAN be primarily the responsibility of the Member States .
a far a the Commission be concern , it be willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload , but we can not give up the practice of check the relevance and quality of the propose programme , indeed you would be the first to criticise u if we do .
a second observation , the time limit for the submission of programme and the possibility of submit a planning supplement in addition to the programme .
I have no objection to the idea of submit a planning supplement jointly with the main programme .
this can not , however , be ground for an extension of the original time limit .
let me remind you that the time limit for this programme be six month .
this time limit , which indeed be identical to the one we grant for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs , should normally be adequate , I feel , for draw up a programme , which do not mean that the project can not be define at a later stage .
with regard to URBAN , I should like to conclude with a final observation .
one of you express a wish that these urban issue should not be confine to the URBAN initiative .
I agree completely .
but , a for the future , since we must look ahead , I be extremely concerned to see how URBAN be go to be implement in practical term , and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn , because plainly these urban issue be go to be the focus of what may be , for future financial perspective , a new European regional planning policy .
I be not forgetting , and we can not forget , that 80 % of the citizen of Europe today live in town and that be why this URBAN instrument be extremely important .
let me repeat what I have say , we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issue in all structural fund programming .
I should now , Mr President , like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur , Francis Decourrière , in the same way that I thank Arlene McCarthy , for the quality and relevance of his work .
have make these general observation , I should like to focus on your main comment with regard to INTERREG .
the first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative .
you comment that these guideline be adopt at too late a date , stress , particularly your rapporteur , the risk that the previous programme will be interrupt .
it be true , I admit it , and you be well aware of the reason , lady and gentleman .
there be a delay in adopt the INTERREG guideline in March or April 2000 .
I accept this ; I take note of it a you do .
I note , however , that the Member States and the region be already actively prepare the programme for INTERREG III and indeed the guidance project be distribute over three month ago now .
I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accept from the date that programme be present and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January , if the programme be present before 30 April .
so much for the first comment .
a to the second comment : regard the non-comprehensive list of measure eligible under strand B , I wish to inform you , to confirm , that I have ask the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subject , particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized business and of cultural heritage , in the list of scheme eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be consider a a comprehensive one .
third point : interregional cooperation , the importance of strand C. The Commission share the observation make by this House regard the importance of strand C , interregional cooperation .
a your rapporteur have request , I shall send you the detailed information regard the system for the implementation of this strand .
fourth observation : the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office .
a you request , I have decide to remove all reference to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service outsource system .
now to the implementation of INTERREG , a subject mention by many of you , and the potential eligibility under strand A , & apos ; cross-border cooperation & apos ; , of scheme in the Adriatic , on behalf of Sicily or for the most remote region , the Commission , lady and gentleman , understand your concern and take note of your request on these various point .
I therefore intend to amend the guideline in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand B : & apos ; integrate cooperation of maritime and island region & apos ; , so a to cover , in what I think be an appropriate fashion the various opportunity for cooperation between these region .
I have decide , in the end , that the most remote region , to which I attach particular importance , will be give special priority in the context of the transnational strand of INTERREG , with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improve their link with their neighbour and other Member State region .
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF , particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean .
all this should make it possible for u , apart from the Objective 1 appropriation and also with them , to confirm the role of & apos ; active frontier & apos ; of the Union .
I adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote region of the Union be actually active frontier of the Union , even if , or precisely because , they be remote and locate in other region of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear .
another point : the coordination between INTERREG , PHARE , TACIS and MEDA .
it be true , once again , and I accept this objectively , that there be still real legal problem .
I do not want to minimise these , but progress be be make a far a strand A cooperation with candidate country be concern , even if the problem relate to the management procedure and to the scale of the project still remain .
the Commission must continue along these line .
I be make a personal commitment to do so .
an initial joint PHARE / CIP committee be to meet in February to assess this coordination , and let me confirm my attentiveness and availability with regard to this , together with my colleague and fellow Commissioners Verheugen , Patten and Poul Nielson .
finally , on the subject of technical assistance , on which your rapporteur and several of you commented.It go without say that the Commission will adhere to the term of Article 23 of the general regulation regard technical assistance , if it be indeed assistance intend to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general .
accord to the general regulation , however , any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be propose under Article 20 , and not Article 23 .
this mean that the ceiling of 0.25 % mention in Article 23 do not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance .
I attach great importance , lady and gentleman , in a spirit of discipline and transparency , to our nonetheless retain some financial strand for matter relate to the exchange of experience and information , and not to propaganda , and to the implementation of network ensure good communication of best practice within the Union .
my conclusion regard INTERREG , Mr President , lady and gentleman , be that these Community initiative for which I be responsible fulfil a real need and everything that have be say be proof of this.They also foreshadow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarge Union .
the Commission attach the greatest importance to this , just a you yourselves do .
I remain at your service in order , when the time come , to present the report of previous plan which you request , but also to keep you inform regularly a to the implementation of these initiative in the course of the new planning .
repeat my thanks to each and every one of you , and also particularly to Arlene McCarthy and Francis Decourrière , I should like to point out that these two initiative lie within a financial framework with which you be familiar : only EUR 700 million for URBAN , but this be better than nothing ; EUR 4 billion 800 million for INTERREG .
so we be work within this framework and not outside it .
on the subject of these two initiative , then , with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regard regional planning and on future financial perspective , let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and it committee .
everything that I have just say , lady and gentleman , demonstrate that the Commission be resolve to take the view of Parliament into account .
Madam President , lady and gentleman , I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report .
however , I should also like to extend thanks to the various committee involve and Parliament a a whole for the broad support which they have give the LEADER + initiative .
this initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original idea , idea which it be then intend should at a later stage be incorporate in the general programme a model .
I be also pleased that Parliament essentially support the Commission & apos ; s view that LEADER + should be apply in all rural area , that override priority should be introduce and that , above all , active cooperation and networking between rural area should be encourage .
in addition , I note that Parliament share the Commission & apos ; s view that the preferred form for implement LEADER + be the use of global grant .
turn now to some of the individual question raise here today , I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER + .
the various group , be they environmental organisation or group concern with employment , have the possibility of take part in draft the Commission directive .
and there will not be le fund available than in the current period either ; there will be more .
I should also like to remind you that the idea of set up an observatory be nothing new .
there be also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II .
it have one purpose only and that be precisely to maintain active networking between the individual LEADER group .
the cost of this observatory be not permit to exceed 2 % of the LEADER budget .
a far a the possibility of have project contain training initiative be concern , I might point out that this be precisely a point which we have now integrate into the new rural development policy , which mean , in our view , that it be no longer necessary to do this a part of LEADER .
I now come to the content of the report .
in point 14 , Parliament call on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II immediately .
I should simply like to point out that this do not make very much sense at the present time because , a you know , it be still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LEADER II fund to be disburse .
we therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme & apos ; s conclusion before carry out the evaluation .
we will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it .
in point 18 , Parliament suggest publish a compendium of example of successful initiative .
in response I can only say that this already exist .
it have already be compile by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who be interested .
in point 21 , Parliament stress that the guideline in LEADER + now need to be adopt quickly so that the programme can start .
I can only fully share your concern .
a soon a the opinion be adopt here in Parliament , the guideline for LEADER + will again be present to the STAR Committee so that the Member States can confirm the provisional agreement which they give on 14 November .
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guideline in March or April .
and a soon a these be publish in the Official Journal the remain month - in fact six month - can be use to submit LEADER + programme .
I believe that it be important to point out one thing : expenditure effect under LEADER + be eligible from the time that the Commission programme start run .
for all programme submit before 30 April of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 January .
finally , under point 20 the motion for a resolution contain seven specific proposal for amendment to the guideline .
have give them thorough consideration , I can tell you that the proposal make under paragraph 2 , 4 , 5 and 7 be acceptable to the Commission and be adopt .
the proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accept because it reaffirm that the time allow for approve programme under LEADER + be a maximum of 5 month .
the amendment propose under paragraph 1 have , in our view , be overtake by event because , follow consultation with the representative of the Member States in the STAR Committee , this point have already be reword along the line propose by Parliament .
that therefore leave only the amendment propose under paragraph 3 .
the Commission can only endorse this request because of course it correspond precisely to what the Commission itself have originally propose .
I must add , however , that cooperation between our action group and similar group in third country go too far for the Member States .
an amendment be therefore make in the committee , but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament & apos ; s concern in the revise version and table the guideline in that form .
it will also continue to fight for Member States & apos ; acceptance of this .
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendment table .
here there be only three which the Commission can not accept , Amendments Nos 3 , 12 and 13 .
it can accept all of the others either in full or in essence .
Madam President , lady and gentleman , it be an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we be debate the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time .
recently , because of political development in Austria , there be grow unease within Europe.Political demonstration be take place a well a political dialogue .
it be worth stress that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policy .
we need specific proposal , both for legislation and for action programme associate with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair society .
so I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committee to appoint their rapporteur so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package a soon a possible .
I now come to the EQUAL initiative , which be , of course , base on Article 13 .
the EQUAL initiative relates to all form of discrimination within the meaning of Article 13 , namely the fight against discrimination base on race , gender , age , and special need .
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Stenzel , because her effort to reach agreement on the EQUAL initiative have prove exceptionally difficult and complex , both because some of the committee involve view the issue in a different light and because it be a very sensitive political issue .
the first comment , which have be make by many others too , be whether woman should be mention separately .
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have express our disagreement about , but that be how the Treaty stand right now and among the category of type of discrimination , discrimination on the ground of gender hold equal place .
so on the basis of the Treaty a it stand today , the EQUAL initiative be structure in that way .
I would like to remind you , however , that there be a special axis for the employment strategy which relate to woman and that a special programme be be prepare , the fifth programme for equality between men and woman .
I have classify the issue raise by the honourable Members into four group .
firstly , the enlargement of the thematic area .
a in employment strategy , there be four thematic area : employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunity , and we agree that those thematic area should be enlarge in line with the European Parliament & apos ; s proposal .
to answer the concern whether there be a risk that a country might concentrate all the fund on one of the category suffer discrimination , I will say that the initiative state clearly that the Member States must submit one thematic category for each group that be suffer discrimination .
the second subject be flexibility and simplification .
I agree with Mr Leinen that the wording of the initiative be indeed very difficult and hard to understand .
that be why the service be already try to revise the text , simplify it structure and make it word easier to grasp .
a regard the subject of flexibility , we propose development partnership and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kind of group would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace , and at the thematic level where , for example , cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector .
this would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular need .
of course , a prerequisite for that be cooperation between the Member States , and a network which will assist the exchange of experience .
finally , I would like to mention technical assistance .
we be try to arrange that there will be four category for which funding be available .
first , fund for preparation ; second , implementation ; third , mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience , and fourth , technical assistance .
since there have be great involvement and concern about how technical assistance be to be provide , we must say that external office will be use .
a Mr Barnier too point out , it be impossible for all the work previously do by external collaborator to be do now by the Commission & apos ; s staff .
the aim at national and European level be to establish large action group by tender , with a full description of the project for which external assistance be to be requested.We would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitor and appraise .
I want to stress that it be extremely important to promote this specific initiative a quickly a possible , both for reason of political timing and because we believe that it be important that it should begin a plan , in other word , we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000 .
thank you , Commissioner .
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteur should be quickly appoint for the file you mention to my colleague in the Bureau and to the appropriate committee .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at noon .
( the sitting be close at 8.40 p.m . )
approval of the Minutes of the two previous sitting
the Minutes of the sitting of Thursday 3 February and Monday 14 February have be distribute .
the Minutes of 3 February be originally distribute in Brussels so perhaps this be why some Members do not receive them .
be there any comment ?
( the Minutes be approve )
Madam President , my habit be always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoon at 5.00 p.m .
yesterday it be impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here , because the 2.15 p.m.Air France flight , which normally bring u here , be cancel , with no explanation from the airline , and we therefore arrived very late .
if Air France insist on boycott the European Parliament , we should take measure to prevent this occur again .
thank you , Mr Medina Ortega .
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation .
would you be so kind a to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authority of both Air France and the French Government ?
this situation really can not continue and we must therefore protest most strongly .
Madam President , I have the same experience a Mr Medina Ortega yesterday .
I feel that the French authority - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connection with all the capital of the Union .
absolutely , Mr Napolitano.Thank you .
Madam President , off the subject of aeroplane delay , I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Caroline Lucas , who be a British Member .
she could not be here because she be arrest yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow .
although her identity be note and her position a a Member of the European Parliament be very apparent , she be still hold in custody all day .
I regard this a absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authority in order to ensure that this do not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receive an apology.I have write to you in this respect together with my colleague , Mrs Hautala .
thank you , Mr Lannoye .
I have receive your letter and have already contact the British Permanent Representative .
Madam President , I should like to make a request in connection with today & apos ; s vote which I start to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report .
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postpone because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point .
I be optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote ; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL .
we just need a bit more time to work out the detail on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postpone from this morning .
Madam President , to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye make : Mrs Lucas be arrest just outside Glasgow for protest against the Trident base at Faslane .
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest .
I have , however , no sympathy for Mrs Lucas try to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity .
I have also be arrest for protest at Faslane .
I do not hide behind any immunity .
I take the punishment that come to me .
Mrs Lucas should do the same .
Madam President , I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel have make to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow .
in fact , this initiative be the subject of a very lively debate in committee , and , give that it be a major Commission proposal , which refer to the agreement we reach last year , I consider it admissible .
we agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote be admissible in the interest of achieve the greatest possible agreement between the group , so that Parliament can express it position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible .
do anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel & apos ; s request , a support by Mrs Ghilardotti ?
if not , then we will proceed to the vote .
( Parliament approve the request )
Madam President , under Rule 29 ( 4 ) you should be keep inform by political group of any Members who have join a new political group or who have leave a political group .
have you receive any notification of any Members leave the Group of the European People & apos ; s Party or do the Austrian People & apos ; s Party continue to sit in that political group ?
Mr Corbett , I have not receive any notification .
Madam President , I be amaze at Mr Corbett & apos ; s reaction .
he should find other way of raise his profile than express view on such matter here .
we be solidly with our Austrian friend who have prove to be good Europeans in the past .
they have our full support .
( applause )
agenda
with regard to the agenda for Thursday , follow a request make yesterday in plenary , I propose extend the debate on topical and urgent subject of major importance by half an hour to 6.00 p.m. when the vote will take place .
( Parliament give it assent )
Commission & apos ; s strategic objective and legislative programme
the next item be the joint debate on the Commission statement on it strategic objective for the come five year and the annual legislative programme for 2000 .
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi .
Madam President , lady and gentleman , a five-year programme be an extremely important undertaking , and this be why I prefer that you be give the unabridged text of the speech , which be available in four language .
to respect my speaking time , I will confine myself to refer only to the broad outline of my programme : a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century , when it be right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective , a Europe which be currently in a paradoxical situation .
let u remember that for half a century , Europe have provide u with peace , security and freedom and a united Europe have also contribute to give u a period of unprecedented prosperity .
we be now see the beginning of a strong recovery , which it appear may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we be prudent with our policy .
nevertheless , despite these aspect , European citizen be disappointed and concern : by unemployment which be not fall quickly enough ; by a Europe trail behind in technology , and seemingly fall even further behind , and in particular a scientific sector which be start to lag a long way behind too ; by the European institution which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the time , start with the Commission itself .
the crisis in the Commission be , in fact , a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and it citizen , and the low turnout at the European election be a worrying indication of this .
even stronger still , however , be the sense of insecurity , the feeling of be unprepared in a new world that be move forward , a world which be completely change , where globalisation will even end up change our point of reference .
this be not the first time this have happen : Europe be once confront with a similar transformation , an explosion of it market , a change in it point of reference and a different view of the world .
I be refer to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turn everything upside down .
some country - such a France and Spain - manage to meet the challenge , give rise to great nation States ; other country - such a Italy - do not meet this challenge and lose all the headway that they have accumulate during the first part of that millennium : headway in science , technology , economic progress , defence structure and military organisation , philosophy and literature .
today , Europe be face a similar challenge , and we know that , just a history have be unforgiving in the past , it will not be forgive in the present .
in this context of wholesale change , and in order to prevent our nation States vanish again , in the wake of globalisation which be create hitherto unprecedented scale and challenge , Europe need to be economically strong , because globalisation demand unity , because every day we hear news of new agreement at world level and news of change at European level too .
but more vital still be a Europe that feel strong in the political arena .
in year past , the single market and the single currency have be the pivotal point of our action , the mainstay of European life .
today , the new frontier of European integration be political frontier : common foreign and security policy , justice and internal security , and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political value on which our coexistence be base .
the Commission have therefore adopt the strategic programme for 2000-2005 , a programme that be immediately send to the European Parliament and with which you be already familiar , so I will not go into detail about it now .
some of you may find it lack detail , but no political structure set out detailed five-year programme .
this be the European Union , not the Soviet Union .
our programme highlight the major point of reference , the major area for action : firstly , the development of new form of governance for Europe ; secondly , extension and enlargement of the area of peace , freedom , and security ; thirdly , the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy ; fourthly , safeguard and improve quality of life .
these will be our major guideline for action over the next five year .
this be an effective , transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institution and the citizen of Europe .
but it be not only enlargement that be urge u towards this rethink : a I say a few moment ago , it be also economic and political globalisation itself .
we must govern Europe in such a way a to make u more efficient , to bring u closer to the citizen and to encourage everyone to get involved , start with the important issue of the involvement of woman .
one of the main difference in the comparison make recently between Europe and the United States be not so much job mobility or risk capital , a woman & apos ; s involvement in economic life , an issue that have much more prominence in the United States than in Europe.This be a field where Europe have , nevertheless , always be in the vanguard .
we therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind , and all the institution - Commission , Parliament , Council - will have to consider their own role and their own policy .
we shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper , although in order to finish it , we shall have to wait for the result of the Intergovernmental Conference , and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001 .
it will not be a philosophical Paper , but a practical Paper , full of focused proposal .
we - the Commission - be the first to know that we must have a total rethink , and we shall therefore do two thing : we be , and will continue to be , fully commit to internal reform , and we shall rethink our policy in detail .
I have ask all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activity that we can forgo .
the Commission must define what it fundamental activity be , what it must concentrate on and shed it non-essential activity , thereby free up new resource and ensure a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual country , region and local community .
so we shall be free up new resource , but - I fear , and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resource that we be already free up will , in turn , be insufficient in term of allow u to address our new task : I be think of enlargement , the new sector of justice and home affair , health issue and environmental matter .
when that time come , when we have use up all our resource , I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resource , but what I be say now be that if we be not give these necessary resource , we shall have to refuse to take on any new duty because the available resource will not be commensurate with the new task that we will be take on .
a for internal reform , you well know how committed my Commission have be to this since day one .
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission do not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform , if it do not become more efficient , if it do not increase efficiency in all sector , start with the sector in which the worst backlog have build up in the past - external aid .
provide aid rapidly , when it be need , save human life ; in many case provide it late be worse than not provide it at all .
when I speak about external aid , my thought immediately turn to the Balkans.There be cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our worker on the ground , an extraordinary commitment give our organisational problem .
this be the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans .
we must increase our efficiency in this area.We must reopen the Danube to boat .
it be contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these country unable to harness their greatest resource .
we must decontaminate the river and , in view of this , over the next few day the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be put forward specific plan to monitor this serious problem .
we have do a lot in the Balkans : the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo , the Balkans Task Force and new regulation to speed up procedure .
nevertheless , we definitely have to do more .
if we do not do this , we shall have fail in our duty .
remember that the Marshall Plan be not effective simply because of the scale of it resource : it be even more effective because it make u Europeans work together towards a new horizon ; it give u a fresh outlook in term of our politics and our economy .
this be what we need to do for the Balkans .
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - it ability to extend the area of security , peace and freedom and it ability to take a leading role on the international stage .
we be clearly , once again , return to enlargement , which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security , peace and freedom .
we have make many promise in this regard , but I believe we shall succeed in keep our promise even though we have a very delicate path to tread .
indeed , enlargement , which will be with u for our five year in office and beyond - I be refer to the aspiration of applicant country - must hinge on concrete , objective criterion , and also on reassure public opinion in the country involve and , to an even greater degree , public opinion in our own Member States .
there will be friendship , calm , openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process .
I repeat : we must reassure public opinion in those country that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance .
our responsibility do not stop at enlargement , or at the Balkans .
there be certain other key issue : relation with Ukraine , relation with Russia , relation with neighbouring country and more importantly , the important question of relation with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history , and for security and peace in Europe for future generations.In this regard , we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa .
we need to provide alternative answer , otherwise episodes such a those see in Seattle will be repeat over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe & apos ; s positive role in history .
all over the world , Europe & apos ; s action must be guide by a deep respect for the principle of freedom and respect for the right of individual and minority .
we should remember that we , the European Union , be a union of minority : we be all a minority within Europe .
there be concern even within the Fifteen , concern which may even surface again in the next decade .
I be refer to the situation in Austria , where the Commission have remain true to it role , be duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union , but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties , ready to punish every minor breach of the principle of democracy , law and respect for minority .
some people have criticise me over the congratulatory message I send to Chancellor Schüssel .
my message to you be : do not take the necessary and proper courtesy of form to mean that I have be le firm in the content .
Reread the letter : the reference to the fundamental value of the Union be take - and this be more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty , I repeat , Article 6 of the Treaty .
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government have ever be remind of these principle by the Commission when they be elect .
this be what we wish to do : maintain our role a a supranational structure , maintain the role confer on u by the Treaties , but also be unwavering on principle and make judgement base on fact .
last November , the Commission table a proposal for an anti-racism directive .
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help u with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental base of our social cohesion .
I will quickly conclude by mention the last two point of our programme : the economy and quality of life .
I have already talk about the economy : we well know which basic ingredient will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more job .
we must continue to keep inflation under control , proceed with liberalisation , ensure more competition , encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technology ; push forward with science , and push back scientific boundary , and develop an appetite for be at the cut edge of science .
the forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issue - dissemination of technology , employment - will be a decisive summit .
it have take four year for u to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind .
we be at last hold it and can not let this opportunity slip through our finger .
finally , our last commitment be to improve quality of life .
we have open this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety : we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector .
the Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrate the press need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment .
the time have come to discuss , and then establish , a body for emergency civil protection in Europe .
all too often we find ourselves call for this after a disaster have occur .
I think it would be appropriate to begin think about these thing before disaster happen .
these be the challenge that we - the Commission but also all the other European institution - be face .
how will we judge , lady and gentleman , Madam President , the five year of our mandate ?
how be we go to assess the result of these five year ?
I do not know , but one benchmark we could certainly use be the challenge we must take up together .
let u take a very simple parameter : turnout at the next European election .
if it be higher than at the previous election , it will mean that we have successfully meet our challenge .
Madam President , lady and gentleman , we be face with all these major political challenge , but precisely because of the recovery that be now underway , we be also face with major opportunity .
this , lady and gentleman , could be the decade of Europe.Indeed , I would say that this must be the decade of Europe .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , the Group of the European People & apos ; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats welcome this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submit a document so that we could prepare for the debate .
we also welcome the conclusion which we find in this document .
and we welcome the broad outline of the speech which President Prodi have just give .
we read in the conclusion in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major change .
Europe will press ahead with integration ; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will , in the end , reunite our continent .
a demanding , ambitious , perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success , Mr President of the Commission .
however , we consider that the present be the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present .
I say that in all earnestness and I have choose my word carefully .
I refer to the current debate on the present conflict in the European Union .
we in the European Union be one Community .
we belong together , even when there be problem .
now be not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unify Europe .
Mr President of the Commission , you have represent and defend the European Parliament time and again over recent week .
you have see yourself a the guardian of the Treaties , and that be indeed your role .
for that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mention , we expressly respect , acknowledge and support you .
( applause )
Mr President of the Commission , our objective be one and the same : we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century , a democratic Europe which be able to act .
a Europe which defend it value of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and , at the same time , look after it global interest with dignity , patience and convince self-confidence .
Europe & apos ; s message , the European Union & apos ; s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism , no ; it must be one of cooperation , partnership and peaceful development .
globalisation give u the chance to shape the world , which be become smaller and smaller , a a world of peaceful competition and solidarity .
see in this light , globalisation be more of an opportunity than a danger , more of a come together than a segregation , more mutual enrichment than separation .
but we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together a Europeans .
globalisation be not only an economic process , it be also a cultural process , which be why we say : we want partnership in the world , we do not want the clash of civilisation which many be predict , we want partnership , a meeting , exchange and peace .
but we also say : we want to defend this European Community of tolerance , which be why a common foreign , security and defence policy be so important .
negotiation with six central European country be start today , bring the European family a step closer together .
we agree with what you say about the Barcelona process .
all the country in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity , democracy and the rule of law .
for u , the Group of the European People & apos ; s Party and the European Democrats , it be not only the reform of the institution of the European Union which will be important in the next five year ; it be also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability a a basis for consolidate the European currency in coming year .
we therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact .
we need structural reform in the European economy .
most importantly , we need to restore a European economy in which performance pay and people can work a entrepreneur .
it would be Europe & apos ; s undoing if we be to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized business in Europe .
( applause ) The Commission have an important role to play here by get a coordinated policy under way with the nation state to reduce tax so that entrepreneurship pay .
we too want to help put Europe on it foot .
you speak in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity .
we support that .
the nation , region , town and community of Europe will be preserve .
however , there be a current trend - the & quot ; fauna , flora , habitat & quot ; directive be quote a an example - which , in my country at least , create the impression that association be bypass national and regional institution and submit programme to Brussels and that Brussels be then make decision affect the property of countless agricultural holding in the country of the European Union .
I merely mention it a an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future .
Mr President of the Commission , allow me to close with these word : a the Group of the European People & apos ; s Party and the European Democrats , we have every interest in a strong Commission .
if you be persuasive in your action , we all reap the benefit .
in this respect we wish you every success.However , we be also aware of our role a the Commission & apos ; s watchdog .
we must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we be to be able to go forth a peacemaker in the world .
( applause )
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , lady and gentleman , first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of , and the first ever debate on , the Commission & apos ; s programme for government - the word President Prodi be so fond of ; a I be -for the whole legislature .
firstly , this be welcome because it explain , to our fellow citizen , what we be intend to do and what we be already doing.We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future .
we have take almost eleven month - President Prodi be nominate at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme.This be not entirely President Prodi & apos ; s fault .
we be recover from a crisis.However , I believe that , in the future , it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme .
we be break new ground and do so in complex circumstance .
President Prodi begin his speech by talk of a paradoxical situation , a paradox in the European Union and also throughout the world : we be at the dawn of a new secular millennium , dominate by the web of the Internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance , and we be live through a genuine change of epoch .
what we need here be good government , Madam President .
since we be recover from a very complex crisis , we must try to enhance our institution and give them substance .
I would like to remind the House of something which we often forget , and that be that the investiture of the Prodi Commission , last September , receive wide support.In our opinion , this demonstrate that the majority of u be in favour of progress and in favour of Europe .
I would like to point out that , within this broad consensus , there be some Groups which say that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council .
it be precisely this which , in a sense , be hinder the important process of develop codecision within the legislative programme .
I be point this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also have to lead to continuity in the work carry out throughout the legislature .
on the other hand , we be witness the birth of a political Europe , which entail a collection of share value which we all agree upon , and a European Union at the service of the citizen .
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it be an essential point .
in this regard , Madam President , I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language .
last week , the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition describe the Austrian Parliament a a farce and a theatre .
those of u who have have to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorship with cardboard government .
there can be no democracy without a living parliament .
I believe that this type of language be extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now .
with regard to the four great priority which President Prodi systematically refer to and with regard to his analysis of the challenge face u , I would say that we be very much in agreement .
nevertheless , I would point out to the Commission that , a far a the Socialist Group be concern , there have be a change of priority .
when speaking of the commitment to full employment , we have to bear in mind that , these day , full employment do not mean what it mean in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War , that be to say , employment for the male head of the household .
we must argue for equality of the sex , the famous & apos ; gender mainstreaming & apos ; , which be one of the least developed question in the Prodi Commission & apos ; s programme .
this mean prioritise sex equality , the adaptation of the social model and , above all , an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion be under threat .
this must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission.It must be complement with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise , in practice , the evolution of a Union which have become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone , give it prosperity and seasonal demographic .
I believe that this be the first objective for u to pursue .
in this respect I would also add another element , which be economic government , give the single currency , and I believe this be inescapable.This be another question on which the Commission must make progress .
with regard to the ambitious objective and , above all , the Commission & apos ; s important step of adopt this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration , I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000 .
do the Commission think that there will be never be any revision ?
the issue of taxation also seem to u to be absolutely essential .
with regard to governance in general , I believe it might be worth think in theoretical term .
I would like to remind you of one thing : it be dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here .
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity .
if we be capable of define what our area of governance be , I think that would be very positive .
in all other area , I believe that subsidiarity be also relevant to this discussion .
not only should the Commission discus this , but also our state , our parliament and our civil society .
Madam President , I would like to refer briefly to the last objective , which seem to u to be absolutely fundamental : the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the Europe & apos ; s role in the world .
it appear that there be agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe , with regard to enlargement and - a I have say already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflict , a well a an issue which we seldom talk about ; the North-South challenge .
we must not forget Africa , a continent which have be forsake , not only by God , but also by Europe , nor our important contribution to cooperate with development .
lastly , an issue for which we be increasingly responsible , a the world & apos ; s foremost economic and commercial power , that be , Europe & apos ; s voice in the world , which do not simply mean adopt an active approach to the Millennium Round .
it mean the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institution , for which Europe have an enormous responsibility .
this be a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us.I hope this will be demonstrate when we hold the next European election .
Mr President of the Commission , may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure , the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today : that be that the stake now be irrefutably political .
they be political because we be move on .
even though we have not yet finish construct all the economic building block , we be move on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective .
the challenge of enlargement be political .
the challenge of create an area of justice and home affair , of deal with asylum and immigration and crime , be very political .
the challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy be very political .
because it be political it be more complex .
because it be political it be more sovereignty-sensitive .
because it be more sovereignty-sensitive it be more voter-and citizen-sensitive .
we need , therefore , to find a way forward towards these political end and objective , to address , not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy , the apathy which you identify .
the mean of achieve this be difficult but they be real .
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institution , not just between Commission and Parliament , but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge .
we need more dialogue , not just with each other but also with civil society .
we need more explanation of what Europe be about .
we need to be able to confront fear and anxiety , because in many instance the greatest fear be fear itself .
perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that .
my group be especially attract to the creative possibility you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring address the issue of governance .
a we look at the Europe of network which you describe , it be very important that Europe concentrate on it core business , that we have the courage to suggest area where Europe may perhaps stand back .
that could convince people that Europe , in it governance , be not something run exclusively from Brussels , which concentrate and soak up more power , more decision , more authority .
that be the political core of the challenge and I think you have identify it well before this House today .
for my group , enlargement be the first priority against which all the other possibility for reform must be measure , be they governance , be they the intergovernmental conference , be they reform of the institution .
we see enlargement a a process of partnership , not a process of & quot ; them and u & quot ; .
we see enlargement a a positive sum gain for member and candidate state .
we need to be able to prepare that ground carefully .
on south-eastern Europe , I agree with your view that we measure political institution through their achievement .
in the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of win the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern Europe .
we applaud the stabilisation and association agreement , but we would like to see more .
we will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week .
the strategic paper emphasise the global role of the European Union .
our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affair commensurate with it weight in term of aid , trade and finance .
at the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institution will develop internationally by it end , and notably where we fit into international monetary body , where we fit into UN agency and so on .
we need to open that debate .
in conclusion , this morning , the day after St Valentine & apos ; s Day , the newspaper be say that your honeymoon period be over .
I do not know whether you be a romantic or not , Mr Prodi .
perhaps this be a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning .
however , we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it mean we be now settle down to business .
that be the way it should be .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally .
you give consideration to important question of principle in your programme .
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issue alongside the day-to-day one .
at the same time , however , it have to be say that , unfortunately , your programme remind me in many way of a party manifesto .
there be a lot of good intention in it , but it very much lack concrete proposal concern how this can all be achieve .
a in any other party manifesto , it be full of contradiction .
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them .
first let me speak about the economy and social development .
we have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment ; that be what be mention in your programme .
should we at long last be draft convergence criterion , in which - a you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than , say , the three most successful country in this matter ?
ecological tax reform be what my group would like to stress the importance of , because we can only create employment and sustainable development by change our taxation structure.But , unfortunately , a we all know , this be an area where the European Union be totally unable to act .
do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference .
the EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focus on task that individual country can not attend to alone .
in this respect , Parliament will definitely defend , along with yourselves , the importance of supranational decision-making .
one contradiction within your programme relate to globalisation .
I think it be very creditable that you should mention the concept of & apos ; global administration & apos ; , a others too have say here .
however , please learn from the event of Seattle : we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade , on the one hand , with all those value of human importance that we wish to defend , on the other .
you must embark on a dialogue with the international community .
do please try to make the international organisation democratic .
the European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring .
we can submit motion for this together with you .
finally , I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society , although , unfortunately , this be another contradiction .
you ought to also be able to draw conclusion at the IGC .
we have to table motion propose that our citizen might really have a direct impact on decision-making .
what you just say be absolutely true : people want more engaged democracy .
in my opinion , this be the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too .
Madam President , my group be one of those which want to have a document allow an exchange of view on the Commission & apos ; s strategic objective within the group before this debate , instead of be reduce to an on-the-spot reaction in plenary .
the main merit of the text of this communication be therefore the fact that it exist .
we be also pleased to see certain statement and intention which it contain and which Mr Prodi have just underline and , in some case , usefully clarify .
the current globalisation process be - and I quote - & apos ; exclusive rather than inclusive and have widen the inequality & apos ; .The European Union & apos ; s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rule within the Union and in international relation .
clearly , many citizen be & apos ; disenchant and anxious & apos ; about the lack of real and lasting solution to basic problem , such a unemployment and social exclusion , which affect our very existence.This must be one of our absolute priority .
we do need to rethink many aspect of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement be to be a success.We also need & apos ; distinctive strategic partnership & apos ; with our neighbour to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace .
there be plenty of area for serious discussion .
we will carefully study the plan White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begin or promise .
it be in this spirit that I have three criticism to make.These must be take into account if we be truly to shape the new Europe , a proclaim ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi & apos ; s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric .
the first and most serious criticism concern the Commission & apos ; s propensity for rather grandiloquent self-satisfaction with regard to the European Union and for a cursory and even condescend view of our partner .
the perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lie in the opening sentence of the Commission communication .
this talk of the European Union a & apos ; live proof that peace , stability , freedom and prosperity can be bring to a continent & apos ; and a a model show the world the way forward.It conclude that & apos ; our neighbour have the chance to join this prosperity , and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so & apos ; .
a more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view .
similarly , the idea that the euro have foster a consensus on wage moderation be not really bear out by the repeat nervous order issue by the European Central Bank to the trade union which be deem to be too demand .
my second criticism follow on from the first .
this extreme difficulty in see the contradiction of the current situation and , where necessary , confront these be seriously limit the will , duly confirm by Mr Prodi , to grant public demand .
my third criticism stem from the first two.The weakness of the analysis and the obstacle to the necessary change have result in a project whose scope be severely limit by an overabundance of generalisation , a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus .
but all be not lose .
this be a starting point and we have five year to succeed , provide that the political will exists and be express with sufficient force and clarity .
my group be fully intent on help with this work .
Madam President , reforming and democratise the institution of the European Union be central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process .
this be the opening statement of Commission President , Prodi , when he present the strategic objective of the European Commission for the next five year .
we await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union deal with the issue of balance between Member States & apos ; government and the European Union institution which be to be publish this summer .
on this specific point I think it be important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedure of the Commission .
the Commission , in it proposal to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference , have indicate that it preference lie in see smaller Member States lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the European Commission .
this be a scenario whereby the European Union have a membership of over 25 Member States .
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built .
I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaty .
there must be equality in term of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institution .
I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nominate a European Commissioner that the United States of America give smaller state the same recognition a larger state in the United States Senate .
more or le each of the 50 state in the US have two elect position in the United States Senate , regardless of it population .
any future reform of the European Union treaty will require a referendum to be hold in my country .
it would be very difficult for those who propose a & apos ; yes & apos ; vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission .
undoubtedly , reform of the European Council be also go to be include in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be publish this summer .
once again there be special area of policy-making which should be leave to the domain of the national Member States .
I do not believe that there be broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority vote on taxation , justice and home affair , and foreign affair at European Union level .
at present , under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome , decision take at EU level concern tax change must be by unanimity .
I believe that this proposal should remain , a a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the working of the European Union .
I support the enlargement of the European Union .
I support institutional change so a to ensure that enlargement of the Union take place in a streamlined and structured manner .
however , we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union be a vital factor in change the EU treaty .
change should not be bring about too quickly and can not be too sweeping , otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed .
Madam President , I be speak on behalf of the Italian Radical Members .
President of the Commission , a short while ago you say that no political structure set out five-year plan .
this be true , if we think of Russia & apos ; s plan in the thirty , but at the start of your mandate , a few month ago , you yourself announce at the Conference of Presidents that you would , however , be present a legislative programme , or rather , the major policy line of the European government of which you be head and in the running of which we be engage today .
in this House , in the past , large-scale debate have take place on major strategic option which the Commission , under it power of initiative , launch , not a experiment , but a proposal which then make vary degree of progress , but in any case do contribute to the integration and development of the European Union .
in this case , Mr Prodi , we certainly have a kind of & quot ; Ten Commandments & quot ; : a whole raft of issue be list , but if I may say so , we be leave with the impression that the Commission be afraid to make any decision regard what need to be do about any of these point .
there be only one point that you really stress - too much in my opinion - and that be that it look almost a if the highest priority task that you be set yourself be to cease & quot ; unnecessary & quot ; activity .
we should be careful , though , Mr Prodi , because we have a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and back this Commission - at least a parliamentary majority back this Commission - precisely because , first and foremost , the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation , a new identity and a new awareness of be guide by a firm hand .
let u consider the scenario whereby the Commission , not believe itself to be equal to the task , wish , or propose to shed , for example , it power to implement common policy , which it be nevertheless accord by the Treaty .
what do we expect from a government in any case ?
what do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which be , so to speak , ambiguous and unique ?
it be right for joint resource to be control supranationally and not to be delegate to the Member States or the TAOs , a have be the case in the past .
it seem that you be propose the same old menu , but with more unsatisfactory implication , restrict the Commission , so you say , to the task of draw up a few White Papers , a you propose .
my fear - even if you shake your head , Mr Prodi - be that this will translate into what some country have think for year , that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers .
if this be the role that the Commission intend to play over the next five year , we federalist be convince , we be certain that this be not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intend to do in this regard .
the reform be important but , if it aggravate the situation , reduces or weaken the supranational power of the Commission , then the structure of European integration , a plan by the found father for the European Commission , will be at risk .
if we continue to get bogged down with proposal that have give extremely poor result so far , I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do .
the same go for enlargement a an end in itself , without it be link to a reform to make the European Union and it structure much more efficient , and to proposal that the Commission could have make at the IGC .
Mr Prodi , there be one positive thing that I would like to say to you , perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members , regard the telegram that you send to the Austrian Government .
we approve of your position on this : you do well not to isolate that country any further .
in any case , we shall see what specific step transpire when the time come for practical action .
Mr Prodi , I repeat that this be , in our opinion , a slightly short-sighted view .
above all , it lack drive in the sector I have mention , for example , a regard the Balkans .
can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process , disregard the fact that Croatia , Macedonia and other country also have the right to a place in this House that be open to all ?
Madam President , Mr Prodi , I should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the Union & apos ; s activity and ask why , then , you be propose a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation .
I remember your predecessor & apos ; s speech five year ago .
like yourself , he promise & quot ; le and better & quot ; , but Mr Santer finish up by have deliver & quot ; much more and much worse & quot ; , and I do not believe that you , either , can deliver the good you promise .
you talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation .
the legislative programme be , in fact , a litany of subject over which the people be to be deprive of influence and in connection with which , Mr Prodi , you be to take influence away from the people , even on social question .
you talk about greater transparency , but produce proposal which would lead to document which , at present , be available for public inspection be lock away .
your Commission consist of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduce .
local politician can not do that , once legislation have be pass in Brussels .
the legislative programme from the Commission ought at least , therefore , to be accompany by a long a list of task which be to be refer back to the Member States and to the process of popular democracy.Otherwise , the number of law produce in Brussels will just keep on grow .
we have pass 10 000 law and a many amendment , and the applicant States have have 26 000 document send to them which , a debate by the Polish parliament , fill 140 000 side of paper .
even by this stage , that be already too many by far .
Brussels should make decision on fewer matter and hand over more decision to the people , the region and the Member States.The only decision which should remain with Brussels be those concern cross-border issue which the national parliament can no longer legislate on effectively .
what be more , the work carry out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent , so that people might at least have some small sense of own the process , now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have take their autonomy away from them .
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell & apos ; Alba & apos ; s attention to what the found father of the European Union dream of.Take a look at Jean Monet & apos ; s memoir .
what he envisage be what he call a small , practical secretariat .
that be not what Mr Prodi be President of today .
Madam President , this morning the Commission President , Mr Prodi , have set out ambitious goal for the European Union for the next five year , laudable aim indeed , to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world : succeeding with enlargement , meet the challenge of sell e-Europe , introduce better principle of governance .
we accept that Europeans , particularly the younger generation , need to be give a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the year ahead .
but how be we to succeed when the resource available be limit and the credibility of our institution be not very high ?
we need to match this vision with reality .
here there be three element I would like to contribute .
firstly , we need a successful European economy .
we must ensure that unemployment rate continue to go down across Europe , confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation , encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet , show that e-Europe be a good initiative .
but we must avoid lurch back into the old-style regulation , stifle individual initiative and enterprise .
we must not fear globalisation , but we must also make sure that we understand it political impact in the network society .
without a successful European economy we can not meet the challenge ahead , particularly of enlargement .
secondly , we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity .
do le but better - a central plank of the last Commission - need to be the aim of this Commission too .
we will be look at this closely when we come to the annual programme of proposed legislation .
Mr Bonde be right to say that there be this image of do le better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposal and recommendation , which seem to go in a different direction .
we must establish priority and make sure there be value for money in each of these programme .
lastly , we need to ensure that there be proper , genuine reform of the European Commission .
yes , the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - be mean to be an independent body , but it also have to be accountable to European citizen through our Parliament .
the information problem , which Mr Bonde just refer to , be treat like a straw in the wind , with the Commission seem to restrict information to u , a citizen and a parliamentarian , although we have the right to it under the Treaties .
the Commission be not in fact today a European government .
the Commission do not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament .
we in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe .
this governance therefore need to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institution in the European Union , have it relevant role to play .
therefore we need to have credibility , coherence and confidence that in work together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizen .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , numerous step have be take in the past to strengthen the European Union , from the euro to resolution on a common security policy ; even to the response by the 14 , the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria .
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principle behind these decision .
that do not apply to Austria alone .
the Union profess it faith in it fundamental value in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institution of the EU confirm this faith once again when the new coalition be form in Austria .
however , the full potential of these value will only be realise if they be set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and , in the final analysis , represent legal claim on the part of individual citizen .
when it come down to it , Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty be not enough .
in this sense , the Commission must insist , and I should like to endorse and confirm this here , that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding , enforceable right .
in this sense , the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom , security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speaker .
only reasonable , feasible and humane principle of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational , misleading and demagogic allegation of the extreme right .
but , and I would like to stress this , this policy must also be accompany by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment , marginalisation and grow inequality be the best breeding ground for anti-European , nationalistic action and reaction .
in this respect , Mr President of the Commission , I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculate on and how it be perceive by large segment of the population .
the feeling of be at the mercy of others , of lack in influence and of have no protection from the state lead in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote , a in the European election and , in the worst case scenario , to extremist voting pattern .
the Union , like everyone else , have not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizen of the EU a a mean of protection against the negative effect of globalisation .
we be in the process of build a house but too few of our citizen really feel at home in our house .
in this respect , what the Commission say about boost Europe & apos ; s voice be important .
you yourself , Mr President , speak of a model of which , unfortunately , there be little mention in the document.You say that we must offer our citizen a model of economic , social , cultural and ecological development , both internally and towards the outside world , which differs from other model , include the US model .
in this sense , the USA be not only our partner ; it be also our competitor ; not our opponent , our competitor and we must fight to see which of u offer our citizen the best model .
I hope that what we have say so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforce in the Commission document .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , the greatest legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumbled and confused power and competence of the Commission , and perhaps of the Union itself .
you have make a bold start by rightly emphasise the need to focus on so-called & quot ; core task & quot ; .
that , a you have say yourself today , mean that you must also identify task , policy and programme which be peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission & apos ; s main vocation .
many exist European Union policy and programme may simply have pass their sell-by date , or have be prove unwieldy or ineffective when administer at European level .
the challenge now be to have the courage to devolve a many non-core task a possible back to lower level of national , regional and local government .
if we be to succeed in persuade a sceptical European public of the merit of further European integration , we must be able to demonstrate that we be a active in the devolution of unwarranted EU power a we be in the evolution of new EU power .
we must not allow the critic of European integration to claim , a they presently do with some justification a we have just hear from Mr Bonde , that the increase in EU responsibility be a one-way street only .
it must be show to be a two-way process in which exist EU policy and programme , which be not clearly justify on the ground of subsidiarity and proportionality , be devolve and repeal .
if you be able to match these aspiration with action in the year ahead , you will be make an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union a a whole and , a we have hear today , you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament .
Madam President , you speak about fundamental political value , and one of the fundamental political value , even more important than democracy , be respect for others .
we therefore feel that you act correctly in send a message and that perhaps those who protest about it be still feel the effect of Bolshevism or Nazism.Democracy mean dialogue with others and make others realise when they be wrong , but also listen to their explanation .
enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale have be repeat this for ten year in this House - must not mean dilution , that be , it must not entail more risk .
the applicant country & apos ; hope be at least a important a the hope of our current fellow citizen , who be begin to feel bitterly disappoint by the way Europe work , a it be not resolve the most serious problem .
we therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreement which - should it be necessary - need to be redrafted with regard to certain fundamental issue such a the environmental disaster that have occur in Romania , reach a far a Belgrade , but above all , the continue spread of apathy a regard major security issue .
even today , we do not have definite answer regard the monitoring of the nuclear power station in the eastern republic .
we therefore need resource available to spend before proceed to enlargement , so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitor quality of life and living condition , with the aim of create a new world where such tragedy will no longer occur .
I would also like to say a few word on Africa , Madam President .
the third and fourth world have be abandon : just one dollar , one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many child .
Europe , which be so democratic , so progressive , do not speak out or take these tragic problem on board , while half of Africa be die of Aids and other disease .
one final remark regard the Internet and globalisation .
globalisation of the economy must not be reduce to product and quality certification , just a the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of value or dampening of hope and enthusiasm .
the people which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hand of a few .
a for the Internet , Europe have finally find the courage to say that we need rule .
on a personal note , please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirate who , by act the way they be , be force the world to reflect on the only system which be currently unregulated .
we live in a world of rule and regulation : let u regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizen rule and hope for the future .
Madam President , a a Padanian taxpayer , I have already experience the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy , Mr Prodi , since Padania be liable to Italy for it tax a well .
listen to him just now , I be concern when he mention new resource , something that readily translate a additional taxation , in view , inter alia , of enlargement , that be the entry of new States into the Union .
but why do they not buy their own entrance ticket ?
my Padanian electorate who , thanks to Mr Prodi , have already pay what in Italy be know a the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention , thanks once again to Mr Prodi , of pay another tax for someone else .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Members of the Commission , five month after it come into office , the Commission commit to paper the direction in which it aim to steer the European Union .
the ensue document be both ambitious and bombastic .
be it not rather melodramatic to say that & quot ; the world look up to Europe & quot ; ?
moreover , Europe a a continent be a great deal more than just the fifteen EU Member States .
it be not rather ambitious to ensure peace , democracy and human right in the whole of Europe , no le ?
I be particularly intrigue by how the Commission considers bring this about .
do & quot ; the European integration model a a rich source for global administration & quot ; imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power ?
accord to the Commission , external policy can succeed , provide everyone know exactly who be in charge !
so who be this then ?
the Commission a a whole , it President perhaps , the Council ?
you state that the new European government require strong institution , while the Commission want to focus at the same time on it core task .
we could not agree more with the latter .
it be high time that institution restrict their scope to actual cross-border issue and stop deck out the European cart with power which they be take away from national authority .
the document mention common value on different occasion .
unfortunately , I find the reference to the relevant standard to be lack .
this raise the question a to what these standard and value be base on .
I be convince that the Bible , God & apos ; s word , be the only pure source of proper standard and real value .
in the tradition of our continent , this realisation be an important one which merit recognition .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , lady and gentleman , I be not sure which to go by : the strategic objective for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010 ?
have you already include your second term of office ?
but seriously .
a it enlarge , the Union need to be strengthen through streamline and demarcation .
first , streamline .
what you say in your programme about concentrate on the core function of the Commission be only the beginning .
the activity of the entire Union must be reduce to core area of policy .
in other word , a social , ecologically-orientated market , a secure currency , guarantee civil right internally and representation of common interest externally .
it be not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice ; it be what we want to say with this voice that it be important .
secondly , the new & quot ; in & quot ; word be flexibility .
however , increase flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation .
we must hold fast to joint decision-making institution which embrace the Member States .
that also apply to the inclusion of the civil society , which be a welcome step .
our citizen do not need any new institution and certainly no new mixing of power .
( applause )
transparency do not mean more access to more paper ; to our citizen , transparency mean greater clarity at long last a to who take decision in Brussels and Strasbourg , when and with what right .
that be transparency .
thirdly , the European Union can not and should not enlarge endlessly .
it border be set not by how may country want to join , but by how many country it can accommodate .
( applause )
if the price of enlargement be the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union , then it must not be pay .
it be too high a price , not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the state which want to join the Union .
there be no future for a Union which be merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which be merely a free trade zone .
but the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredit by the people of Europe if it see itself a a community of destiny .
that go far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new , better quality of life .
not only the Commission , not only the European Parliament but also the people and the state in our European Union will have to find new answer to the question of how and why we want to live and work together .
in do so , we need , no le , to reinvent the European Union , but without destroy the present Union .
( applause )
Madam President , in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party , the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the come year be the successful realisation of enlargement .
the Commission must carry on negotiation that be a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union a soon a possible .
on the other hand , we have to see to it that none of the achievement or aim of integration that have be state thus far be water down .
to avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have express the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various model of differentiated integration and create a concentric Union , in which there be a federal core and a le integrated outer ring .
it be clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raise at the IGC .
the subject need to be discuss without prejudice .
a technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough : we also have to raise the issue of develop our institution for the country in the vanguard a propose by Jacques Delors , for example .
in this way , a decision-making system can be create that be more effective , clearer , more open and more democratic .
I hope that the Commission will make it own proposal concern how the expand Union might implement it institutional and other differentiation .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , your inspire speech , Mr Prodi , have quite win me over .
it raise expectation , but it can also lead to disappointment .
this be connect to what Mr Van Velzen be just say , about the difference between word and deed .
the enlargement of the Union be inspire by our wish for peace , security and stability .
you be look to reassure the acceding country , a well a European opinion .
but these day , we be witness the exact reverse before our very eye .
we have note increase level of apprehension and disquiet , even within region where unemployment be quite low and prosperity very high .
we need to make our citizen feel at home , accord to Mr Swoboda , and I agree .
this be a place where we share the same value and where each and one of u also have our own task and responsibility .
this be probably link to the standard mention by Mr Van Dam , namely subsidiarity .
it be necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all level of authority and to be partner , rather than competitor when it come to policy .
it be also necessary to exercise authority a closely a possible to the citizen , where it can be exercise with due transparency and can be monitor by the citizen themselves .
that will require a new political culture , not only in word , but also in practice , which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and region .
region which , culturally and economically , sometimes match the interest of some Member States .
the new Europe should not only expand horizontally , but also vertically , by living by our value in practice and by develop a democratic structure of a real community .
this be what the Commission will be judge on .
Madam President , the Commission be today present it strategic objective for 2000-2005.These be contain in an extremely general document in which all the problem have be gloss over to prevent any conflict .
so , in the first part on the new form of European governance , the word & apos ; federalism & apos ; and & apos ; superstate & apos ; be not mention at all .
these ambiguity mask many misunderstanding , primarily about our value .
it be not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat .
it must clearly be accept that the people should be free to make their decision at the level which best combine the objective condition of an immediate , fair and transparent democratic debate , namely at national level in the main .
yet the whole of the Commission communication be base on the opposite theory.In this theory , on the pretext of ensure the best protection for people , their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limit by new regulation , new policy or new , restrictive legal structure such a the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights .
this Charter be really misname because it will actually reduce these right .
in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principle be rather different .
clearly we want to defend the country of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nation .
this be not impossible .
we must move away from the outmoded federalist scheme promote by those whose every idea on European matter come from the Memoires of Jean Monnet .
instead , we must open the European institution to the modern world by create a flexible dynamic which respect nation .
this be the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have like to have see in your communication , Mr Prodi , but which be unfortunately not there .
Madam President , Mr Prodi , you claim to be shape a new Europe yet you be lack one basic element : confidence .
the confidence of million of Europeans can not be win without be worthy of this .
and how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption ?
you be responsible for million of unemployed and for million live in poverty , insecurity and increase misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policy and because of the force march towards the single currency .
you want and have obtain the abolition of internal borders.Consequently , you have open Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration .
you be now propose to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials.The Member States , local authority and NGOs will simply become enforcer of decision hand down from above , all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels .
not once do your twelve-page document mention the national parliament even though they comprise the elected representative of the people .
clearly , they have no role to play in your strategy .
you dare not even call a spade a spade , but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by use the term & apos ; governance & apos ; for what be nothing more than federal , autocratic , centralised government .
have try for many year to persuade u by talk of share sovereignty , you be now reveal your ultimate goal.You intend to trade in all European sovereignty , whether national or collective , for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position .
finally , you be dare to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of million of Austrians , or be allow this to happen , just because the result do not suit you .
yet at the same time you be support Communist China and trading with country which have openly violate human right for decade .
Members of this House be today speak out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which , quite obviously , be not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre .
your sabre-rattling fool no one because , a you know perfectly well , whether you like it or not , you need Austria in order to reform the Treaties and harmonise saving tax .
you will cynically and hypocritically use Austria a a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real power in the construction of the European Union .
your Commissioners be clearly not solely responsible for this .
the government which , through spinelessness or ideology , support you be also responsible .
Brussels be not all of u , a you claim.It be all of you .
tell the truth for once.You could not care le what the people of Europe want .
they be free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement .
it be over ten year since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your project contain a strong hint of the gulag and mollify moralism .
we be among the small number who denounce the communist dictatorship .
we be and will remain among those fight against Europeanist dictatorship.We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous project .
the salvation of European democracy be with nation states.Europe & apos ; s salvation lie in the cooperation of the nation of Europe .
( limited applause )
President Prodi , today you have present the Commission & apos ; s five-year programme , and it have many objective that we endorse .
it be a programme base on real-life situation and issue , and it be therefore right to put concrete measure aside for the moment and focus on the major issue .
in my view , Mr Prodi , judge from the text and the document that you have send to u , one subject that be very important to both of u have be give secondary importance , and that be solidarity , not so much at international level a at internal level .
it be of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who can not keep up , one which remind u of how difficult and complicate it be to establish progress indicator and how inadequate it be to use the parameter of per caput income alone .
it also remind u of the need for a new growth model , one that be firmly root in the culture of the Catholics who be involve in social problem , who see , in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encourage and facilitate among the public , the most natural instrument for building solidarity .
the fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom , which come before economic gain - be thus enhance .
this social freedom , which become manifest in initiative favour the poor , give excellent result in term of social justice and stability .
Mr President , public institution must not accept only the economic criterion .
they must focus on service to people and commitment to achieve freedom for each individual , without forget , naturally , that all this can not and must not conflict with the need to create business , to invest and risk , and in an ordered and focused system , entrepreneur be able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity .
in the age of globalisation , which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rule that will provide guarantee to the economic operator and consumer , the European Commission can not forget solidarity , and must call for it implementation through the use of all of man & apos ; s spiritual resource in his relation with his fellow man .
our heritage have teach u that politics must have a heart .
we hope that the White Paper and the action of you and your Commission will put this into practice .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , & apos ; Shaping the new Europe & apos ; be an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for u all .
our ambition and our work will be follow not only by people in our own country , but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union .
what sort of impression will an interested public , a well a the rest of the world , have of this five-year programme ?
my reply would be : a new start , a clear agenda for reform which confirm that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at be an economic community but will become a community that can be trust and that we take seriously .
the Commission be correct in state that the Union intend to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation .
it foresee a just and more effective Europe that also recognise it responsibility beyond it own border out of solidarity and enlighten self-interest .
consequently , we see poverty and exclusion a the greatest enemy of peace and freedom .
I concur with what other member of my political group have say and I commend the tone of your document.However , there be two omission which need to be address in our future work .
the first concern woman , gender and woman & apos ; s right .
you talk about how woman can help in increase production and growth .
that be important , but equality be not only necessary for productivity , but also to make our society more democratic .
it be therefore noticeable that & apos ; equality & apos ; , & apos ; gender & apos ; and & apos ; woman & apos ; be barely mention in & apos ; Shaping the New Europe & apos ; .
you mention & apos ; woman & apos ; in your speech , but they be not refer to in the context of the strategic goal .
be that because mainstreaming be already so widespread in the Commission that there be no need to mention woman ?
what other explanation could there be for omit woman ?
the EU must not take on a masculine persona .
my other question concern Africa , which be the only continent not mention in & apos ; Shaping the New Europe & apos ; .
Africa have the largest number of refugee in the world , the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic .
I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other Commissioners be do a fine job , but the rest of the Commission also need to focus more clearly on that continent , partly by include it among it strategic goal .
finally , I welcome the Commission & apos ; s statement and the fact that this say for the first time that the EU be prepare unilaterally to introduce measure to make it easier for develop country to gain access to our market .
I would merely ask when this be likely to take effect .
Madam President , President of the Commission , this be a vital document for the future and fate of Europe .
however , out of all the point , two specifically require our attention , and they be closely link : peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe .
it be a question of objective that must be pursue a a priority .
for some time , we have all agree on this notion , but we must also clearly affirm that these objective will not be achieve without enlargement , even if this come at a price .
today , we have be call on to choose , for the forthcoming decade , between a Europe that might be le prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy , but where there be uncertainty over what the future might bring .
these goal will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference , which will draw to a close within the year , result in constitutional reform , provide the Commission with real and adequate power so that it will no longer merely implement Council decision or Parliament & apos ; s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government .
the first supporter of this reform should be Parliament itself , if it really want to increase it role of interpret the will of the Europeans and acquire the centrality which be part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrate Union .
moreover , it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the task it take on accord to the actual power it will be accord .
without these prospect that we have outline , Europe would , once again , have no future .
Madam President , Mr Prodi , we be pleased about the overall intention of the objective announce which be in line with the challenge which Europe must overcome .
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century .
this event must underpin enlargement .
rather than use the word & apos ; enlargement & apos ; , I want to talk of reunification which have much greater political significance .
your idea be to concentrate your activity on the core tasks.This be one of the goal of your reform .
in essence this mean apply the principle of subsidiarity .
precise application of this principle can only reinforce the action take and give our citizen a clear view of each level of competence .
however , say be one thing and do be another !
you must therefore fight against the tendency of all institution to try and increase their power .
I will therefore judge you on your deed .
in the meantime , I approve and encourage this clearly express desire in your communication .
however , I must make two essential points.These concern the simplification and application of Community law .
in 1998 , 123 referral be make to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25 % of environmental directive be not apply or transpose .
recent event have show u that these regulation be essential .
Community law must not go unapplied because it be too complex or too pedantic .
the Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication do not go into more detail on this .
you be be realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate response to the problem face u , include unemployment .
nevertheless , I regret that a clear alternative have not be propose .
the emphasis should have be place on the rejection of any policy of handout and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility .
you have not highlight the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society , not only economically but also in term of public health .
this be a silent revolution and in this respect I expect more from your communication .
finally , you do highlight European research a be at the heart of our future .
yet you do not indicate the resource you intend to implement to achieve this .
also , ethical principle be at the heart of this research but your communication say nothing about these .
if you want to better inform the people , you should start by strengthen liaison with this House , a we be the representative of the citizen .
Madam President , we can only endorse the general guideline of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000 , set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning .
to this end , I shall confine myself to stress , out of all the choice available , the importance of three priority decision which should , in the drawing-up of action programme for the government of the Union , be the basis for both the Commission & apos ; s agenda and the action of the European Union in the coming month .
firstly , the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plan for the creation of an integrate service network in the transport and energy sector , with the backing of the European Investment Bank .
secondly , the approval of investment - where the parameter be bind when draw up action programme on employment - to be make in individual country via Community project in the priority sector of research , innovation and training .
I feel that these parameter - particularly those of a qualitative nature , result from investment in continuous training , refresher course , adaptability and retraining of older worker - be considerably more significant and bind owe to their lasting effect over the medium term than the simple draw up of annual quantitative objective , that be always debatable , regard new employment or employment cut .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , you have come here today , Mr Prodi , in a very reformist and ambitious mood .
I welcome you and your ambition .
ambition will be need , give the mammoth task which await u .
in order to make these reform , however , and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme , we must be very sure , not only of the strength of the reformer himself , but also of the opinion of others .
you say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resource for the Commission , but the Commission must be aware that we be walk on thin financial ice .
we have 1.27 % of the Community & apos ; s GDP .
not a euro more or a euro le .
it will not be u who refuse these new resources.You should ask the Council .
these financial perspective be adjust to within a millimetre .
in order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans , we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4 , and you must remember the enormous difficulty we have have in approve the 2000 budget .
I would remind you that this Group , the PPE-DE , do not like to finance new political initiative at the expense of exist one .
the political priority must be set by this House and the MEPs .
do not believe for one moment that your propose reform of the budget will disguise the limitation of the Community financial system .
it be all very well for u , by mutual consensus , to make an effort in term of budgetary rationalisation , but you must be very aware that the lack of resource , the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget , continue to be urgent issue which must be resolve .
we therefore wonder whether the Commission have the political will to resolve them .
Madam President , the Commission communication be well write but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever .
on one hand , there be the word and , on the other , their real political meaning .
we Socialists applaud the Commission for want to fight against social exclusion and poverty .
yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be fill ?
what be mean by the Commission & apos ; s declare objective of & apos ; economic reform & apos ; in the labour market ?
do this mean more flexibility , insecurity and fixed-term contract ?
everyone know that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth .
the Union be currently restrict to a policy of stability which be certainly necessary but insufficient .
we Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment .
the ingredient of this policy be well known.They be the stimulation of public and private investment , increase investment in research , education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise .
in this respect , the e-Europe initiative be to be welcome .
in the world of new technology , the main danger remain that access to information will be easier the richer you be .
the gulf which be open up everywhere be the main problem for our era .
on one hand we have the exuberance of the financial market and the explosion of wealth and , on the other , more widespread exclusion .
we be ask worker to be flexible , innovative and ever more productive , yet the fruit of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholder alone .
the European Central Bank be keep very quiet about the staggering rate of return on financial asset , yet it never miss an opportunity to remind u that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity .
how do we explain to worker who fall victim to the rationalisation of the worldwide Monopoly game that they must be prepare to change career several time in their working life when the captain of industry , have lose the gamble of a take-over , leave with compensation of EUR 30 million ?
for year we have be tell over and over that the economy must be liberalise .
the sector which have be liberalise be experience an avalanche of merger and acquisition , lead inevitably to monopoly situation .
all these stock market battle be base solely on forecast increase in profit of 15 % , 20 % or 25 % which be unrealistic in the long term .
the unfettered rise in price of financial asset and property mean that the risk be on the increase .
the main danger await u in the medium term be not inflation but deflation cause by the collapse of the speculative bubble on the international financial market .
to conclude , the next five year will be crucial .
we need new rule to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people.We need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , in my view , this strategy paper have two clear weakness .
there be no point in draw up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finish the old one .
I be think of transport policy and regional policy .
you have excellent Commissioners for both issue in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier , yet still you attach too little importance to these area .
and do you know why ?
just look at transport policy ; clearly it be crucial for this policy to be draw up a a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other country .
I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say , although of course he have no obligation to do so .
let me give you three example .
first : we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the road to the railway .
that make sense from an economic and an ecological point of view .
without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy .
the same applies to European air traffic control .
our citizen can not understand that we be deregulate air traffic , but leave 15 different sector in the sky which be under national control , which have an adverse economic impact on the airline and which pollute the environment .
you still have not finish that agenda .
Commissioner , far too little be say in your paper about regional policy .
economic and social cohesion in the EU be a fundamental task of this Community .
if we fail to complete it , citizens in le favoured region will dread enlargement .
we must show them that we intend to use the next five year to help them join the rich region by promote the le favoured region use reasonable mean .
then they too will be prepare to really support enlargement and help to achieve it .
Mr President of the Commission , if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor region , then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , the fact that we be formulate new programme do not mean that we should neglect those older programme which be at implementation stage .
from that standpoint , it be useful that the Commission & apos ; s work programme come back to the issue of Agenda 2000 , the common agricultural policy , which include fishing , and secondly , the activity of the structural fund .
I hope this reference mean that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implement Agenda 2000 .
the Agenda 2000 issue be , of course , one that relate to your third and fourth strategic objective , the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life .
what your text do not make apparent be the extent to which these major , high-minded objective be compatible with the resource that the Commission intend to deploy .
I do not necessarily mean financial resource .
the implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector do not ultimately require more money .
there must also be saving .
but what we need be the analytical resource : these issue require the investment of more intellectual capital .
this be because it be essential to achieve two thing : the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secure , and this must be do in a way which facilitate the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural product , mainly to the benefit of develop country .
it be not easy to combine those aims.There be no obvious way .
there may well be contradiction between the two objective and there be nothing to show that the Commission have point out those contradiction and how it propose to deal with them .
a regard the other aspect of Agenda , the aspect of cohesion and regional development , there we do indeed have great achievement to point to , but there be still le developed region , particularly island region , to which more attention should be pay .
a for fishing , there be nothing in your programme to tell u that the predatory exploitation of fish ground , which have go a far a to wipe out entire specie of fish , will certainly prove fruitful in the future .
perhaps these issue should be approach with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse .
Madam President , I want to start by reinforce the caution that have be express by many colleague here in address this five-year plan .
in set very ambitious long-term goal we must not take our eye away from the present .
that be a point make very forcibly by the leader of my group , Mr Poettering , in his opening address .
the Union must not take on a whole range of new task without the basic foundation for a successful European economy be in place .
that foundation be clearly the single market .
how strongly be the single market establish at the moment ?
I want to remind Mr Prodi , and his colleague who be still here , of the finding of the Commission & apos ; s own survey among 3000 European business .
nearly 40 % of business in this survey be still report additional cost to render product or service compatible with national specification .
this be the Commission & apos ; s own survey .
these be the classic symptom of continued obstruction by national government - bureaucratic red-tape block market entry .
the Commission & apos ; s programme show a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market .
we have to keep the pressure up in all area by remove further barrier , intensify pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measure and , of course , extend into crucial new area like financial service .
only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieve .
an enlarge Europe must build on the exist strength of the Union .
the single market extend across that enlarge Union be go to be a colossal achievement .
I conclude by say , on behalf of all my Conservative colleague - and we be the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieve this historic task .
Madam President , Mr Prodi , lady and gentleman , at the time of our vote on your appointment we invite you to come here today .
the serious business be therefore now go to start a we be to vote on your programme .
from your speech I will concentrate on what you have call the new governance , which you will use a a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizen .
yet this new governance simply mean how the institution and our public authority operate , if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority .
the interlinking of the EU institution , the responsibility of the Member States and the local and regional authority be all very well .
yet be this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction ?
be this really how we will answer the fundamental question which be not so much about & apos ; who do what & apos ; but more & apos ; what be we do together & apos ; ?
it be these question which cause concern among our fellow citizen .
in your speech you mention the challenge of globalisation and enlargement which await us.I would add to these the future of our social model .
our people expect more Europe , but not just any Europe .
they be expect u not to fall in with globalisation but rather , on the basis of our social model , to be able to organise globalisation .
in this respect I must say that , in term of your commitment to a political union , to which we be favourable , this can not be achieve unless it be base on our social model , on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , I should like to start with a quote : & quot ; the Commission will continue to work towards establish a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposal to bring about an ambitious programme .
the Commission be plan in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration.It wish to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all form of crime & quot ; .
that be the entire programme for the next five year on the question of internal security , freedom , citizens & apos ; right and judicial cooperation .
a paper this short be a farce .
a farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper be a blatant contradiction to how thing actually stand .
a paper such a this be no basis for a scoreboard .
it have be extol and celebrate a a huge achievement and I be all for it ; we need a basis for a scoreboard .
we here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme .
what we be look for be minimum standard in asylum procedure so that refugee can be give help quickly , and those who be not flee know where they stand .
we want instrument to prevent abuse .
we want to develop a Community immigration policy which take account of the Member States & apos ; capacity to absorb immigrant and we need to extend the operational power of EUROPOL , for example , so that specific step can be take to combat organised crime .
we debate these issue intensively and seriously and we should be entitle to expect likewise from the Commission , even where it be merely submit a paper .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation , on which there be a broad convergence of view between the Commission document and the position of the Socialist Group.This be not the case in other area , a have already be point out .
we share these view because we be in favour of world trade , but we want this trade to be conduct accord to common standard , common rule which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind.This aim be that trade should benefit development , and particularly harmonious development in which the value of citizenship do not only apply to the world & apos ; s most dynamic and competitive region .
on the other hand , what do this statement tell u about principle ?
this regulation and these standard have bring an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation , in other word , increase wealth , but when we look at how this wealth be distribute , we see , unfortunately , that the gulf between the world & apos ; s richest country and block and the poorest and least developed country continue to increase .
it be therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves , what purpose do the current common standard and rule serve ?
what good be the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation work , if they cause trade to increase on the one hand , but on the other , they create problem and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor country to grow ?
that be why we say that we be in favour of the strategy that the Commission outline here for the Seattle negotiation and for later one .
we be certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious .
we need to be demand and ensure that social right , environmental right and consumer protection be incorporate into the forthcoming negotiation .
most importantly though , we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform , not just of the WTO but also of the ILO , the United Nations and above all , of the financial institution , specifically the IMF and the World Bank .
we must be brave and not only see some aspect of globalisation.We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process , so that wealth do not only benefit the most highly-developed block and country , but that there be also harmonious change and development in every region in the world .
Madam President , I would also like to welcome the Commission & apos ; s initiative of present u with a report on it strategic objective for the next five year , although I hope that it intend , in subsequent document , to avoid the excess of generalisation and the vagueness of the text which we be examine today .
have say this , Madam President , I be prepared , once again , to be a voice cry in the wilderness a a result of the absence of a fishing policy .
it be really surprising that the Commission do not treat the revision of one of it common policy a a strategic objective for the come year , in view of the reform which must take place in 2002 .
there be no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many year .
however , it seem that the Commission do not share this view , although it be the Commission which be oblige to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fishery policy over the last decade before the end of 2001 , and it be on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decision with regard to it modification .
in fact , the revision process have already begin for many body and institution , such a the European Parliament , which in 1998 already issue and adopt a report point out all the current problem and deficiency of the common fishery policy .
we have often ask for a basic timetable for this revision and we have receive no reply .
le than two year be not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy be anomalous with regard to the internal market regulation and that such anomaly should be resolve within the framework of this reform process .
therefore , Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I would ask that this issue , which be of vital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union , be take into account in this strategy and these strategic objective for the next five year .
Madam President , I should like to add my congratulation to Commissioner Prodi & apos ; s programme .
I have one observation , not a criticism , to make regard Commissioner Prodi & apos ; s statement this morning and that be that it be a little weak on the actual content of economic policy .
we must not take anything for grant in term of how we get the European economy restructure .
after all , what be social justice if it be without full employment ?
full employment be the best way to generate social justice for our citizen .
this be a key priority for u to focus on .
I should like to welcome one or two initiative that have already come from the Commission which will help u : in particular Commissioner Liikanen & apos ; s commitment to have an innovative knowledge-driven economy .
yes , e-Europe will be the future for u because it will help u create new prosperity and new job .
I welcome the Commission initiative now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprise and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for it initiative on have a charter for micro-businesses .
that be important and something that can be develop through the Lisbon Summit .
I also welcome Commissioner Busquin & apos ; s idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union .
again , this be a way that we can help create better opportunity for job and for prosperity .
you say in your summary , Commissioner Prodi , that liberalisation , competitiveness , keep inflation low , innovation , science and technology be central for the future success of the European economy and create job .
I very much agree with you on that , but we can take nothing for grant .
there be still more we have to do , and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that .
so with those remark I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I should like to focus on two point which be not mention in your programme .
to me , this Commission strategy paper for the next five year read like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle .
unfortunately , it do not give the impression of be a real political strategy on the part of the Commission .
a the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group , I would have expect more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission .
the Commission give no soul to Europe .
culture and training simply do not exist in this paper , despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe .
just a few main point .
I be talk about the integration of the policy of the culture industry in this area of training and culture ; they create job .
I be talk about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy area , about consolidate and improve the European dimension of training and education syllabus and about network training and education policy in Europe especially lifelong learn .
Mr President of the Commission , it be the new millennium and you make no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe .
nor be any mention make of information policy and communication cater to the need of our citizen .
it seem to me that something be miss from this programme .
truly European citizenship depend on our create a real , visible area of training and culture .
declaration of principle be not enough .
we need an agenda which can be translate into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just describe .
Madam President , Mr Prodi , how would you take stock of your policy and work programme , what would your benchmark be , if you have to make direct choice ?
you have the fine , charm idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the election , or rather the turnout at the next European election .
when I think that I have to explain your work programme week in , week out to my constituent , not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House , but on the street , then I ask myself , what can I say ?
Mr Prodi , what can I say ; what be there that be new ?
there be nothing new in your work programme .
you have take 12 page for five year and 18 page for one year & apos ; s work programme .
do that give me hope for the year 2000 ?
no , it do not !
in your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever .
you say that environmental consideration must be integrate into all other policy area .
have you do so , Mr Prodi ; have you even read your work programme for the year ?
no , you have not do so .
you have not integrate environmental policy into enlargement , despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problem of enlargement .
nor have you integrate it into economic policy , competition or the internal market .
you have not integrate it anywhere .
you have tack a few component together but you have no overall structure .
you say earlier in your speech that a disaster such a that of the Danube be an example of the need for an emergency structure ; no , Mr Prodi , we need , at long last , to start transpose legislation and ensure that legislation be monitor .
you say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standard to be higher and better foodstuff legislation .
Mr Prodi , you do not know what you be talk about .
the foodstuff legislation in the European Union be the most ambitious in the world .
where it fall short , what be miss , be transposition in the Member States and monitoring .
it be time you take your job seriously , it be time for you , a President of the Commission , to box the Member States on the ear and force them to do their work and fulfil their duty .
it be no good spending time on hobby when there be a day & apos ; s work to be do .
that be what we expect of you in the next five year .
( ES ) Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , a chairman of this Parliament & apos ; s Committee on Fisheries , Mr Prodi , you be not make thing easy for me at all .
I feel duty bind to publicly denounce the fact that fishing be absent from the programme which you have present to u .
the next five year of the Prodi Commission - a you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusion - will mean great change .
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing , since the silence of your programme , with regard to fishing , be deafen .
not a single line , nor a single word , refers to fishing or the CFP .
I be not ask for detail or specific point , but I believe that a mention be require .
how could you completely ignore a common - I repeat ; common - policy with such an economic , social and regional impact , and which therefore affect the economic and social cohesion of Europe ?
this be all the more serious , if that be possible - a others have say - bearing in mind that your Commission , Mr Prodi , have to carry out nothing le than a revision or reform of the current common fishery policy , which you be legally require to do in 2002 .
do the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it have announce nothing - about this reform in 2000 either ?
you have make an explicit reference to the CAP for the come year , but you have not do so for the CFP , with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which be necessary to prevent exception - a have already be say - and in a global context , in the context of globalisation .
this House have express it opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second .
I would therefore ask you , Mr Prodi , to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today .
our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you .
Mr President of the Commission , this be indeed an historic moment for Parliament , a five-year programme follow the crisis of the Commission .
on behalf of the Socialist Group , I would like to focus on the point of internal reform .
we wholeheartedly support the programme a it be now lay down in a consultative document and which be also include in the programme of Vice-President , Mr Kinnock , on behalf of the Commission .
we consider it to be of utmost importance that , in term of financial control , personnel management and bureaucratic short-cuts , we can expect swift line of policy and a more effective bureaucracy , for the benefit of the citizen .
at the same time , we be aware that this be a massive programme and that , during the overhaul in the next couple of year , it will be necessary to keep the actual result come in , a before .
much like in the Netherlands , where , at a give point , woman wake up to the fact that , by refer to European legislation , they could improve their status in term of social security , this be now also the case for score of other citizen .
they want to see result .
democracy , transparency and clarity always lead to result , citizens value result and this be what the Commission be judge on .
this be exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other Members make : fear of modernisation , globalisation , and the individual lose his own sense of safety and security .
this can be prevent if a European social model be draw up and if result be achieve in all these concrete area .
I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which deliver fast and concrete result at a social level.This give the citizen a sense of recognition , here in Europe and elsewhere .
because this citizen - one in five globally - still have no access to elementary social provision , such a education and health care .
these be really the people who deserve our solidarity .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I have read and re-read the Commission & apos ; s document set out the strategic objective for it term in office .
I be delighted that it be be discuss in Parliament , but I also note the compromise and the omission in it .
the Commission make only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion , to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union & apos ; s regional policy .
and this be true even when it address the issue of enlargement .
be reduce the disparity between level of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objective that we have already achieve ?
certainly not !
at the same time , it be rightly point out that Europe must evaluate it role a a joint partner with develop country , and strengthen it activity design for fight poverty .
this document leave out issue which clearly should have be include .
I think the fact that the Commission do not address the issue of cohesion be extremely serious .
it play down one of the Treaties & apos ; principle - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institution & apos ; policy and measures.It seem to ignore the fact that various European region be still considerably le advanced than others .
it also forget that enlargement mean that we must get regional policy right.Unless we achieve real convergence , the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk .
we should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the region in the European Union , for which the Commission be responsible .
this report confirm that whereas an average level of development be give a rating of 100 , the ten so-called & quot ; strongest & quot ; region reach an average of 158 , and the ten so-called & quot ; weakest & quot ; region reach a figure of around 50 .
you may draw your own conclusion .
50 be exactly the level of development of my own region , the Azores , one of the region define in the Treaties a ultra-peripheral .
I be wait for the Commission & apos ; s report on the ultra-peripheral region , which the Council decide should be draw up by December 1999 .
I shall finish by restate my conviction that without economic and social cohesion , there will be no cohesion at all , only disunity .
a intend by the Treaties and the will of the people , the Commission be the drive force of European construction which be like a rock of Sisyphus which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement.We therefore need a strong Commission but one which rely on the support of a parliament .
this House be therefore your ally but not one which be too accommodating.You must therefore listen to our opinion , one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech .
firstly , Mr President , although your two predecessor concentrate on develop an internal market and establish the single currency , it have be leave to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which be at the heart of European construction .
you must not allow yourself to be distract by the sole issue of enlargement , however important this may be .
you must go further , towards reconcile the people with Europe , in particular those people who be fall victim to economic , social and , probably , in the future , technological division .
the promotion of scientific development and new technology and access for all to these technology will not be provide by the market or competition.The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community service of health , education , transport , communication , water and whatever else .
your action programme and your objective be reserve , even silent , specifically on the stimulation of public investment which be need .
this be also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest service .
this be an absolute priority if you be to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than Jörg Haider .
Madam President , the Commission be correct to make food safety one of it top priority .
the recent dioxin scare in Belgium , prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain , and the continue controversy over the safety of genetically-modified food , have all contribute to undermine consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat .
if the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institution themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the right of EU citizen .
I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety , public health and consumer confidence feature prominently in the Commission & apos ; s work programme for 2000 .
however , I be disappoint with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper .
in it present form , what be be propose be more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision- and law-making power more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration , which have already establish credibility in this particular field .
furthermore , future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authority of national Member States , for example the food safety authority in Ireland .
this body , for example , alongside the recently establish cross-border body in Ireland for food safety , be already do good work .
it would be a tragedy if their effort be to be undermine by deficiency in EU legislation .
my fear be that such deficiency in EU legislation could lead to turf war between national and EU body , who should be work together rather than against one another .
that be something we must guard against .
Madam President , the presentation by President Prodi today have necessarily be a fairly broad brush affair .
we will be look for the detail year by year , for example in the social action programme to be unveil this year .
we will also be look at this from the perspective of social and employment policy , and will be apply a number of test .
we will be look at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combine economic policy , employment policy and social policy .
at the moment , social policy be trail well behind economic and employment policy .
within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy follow the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework be propose by the Portuguese Presidency .
within the social dimension we will be look for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect .
we also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that company in fact work in partnership with their worker in the management of change .
that be the successful way to manage change , and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that be put into place .
finally , with the emergence , the resurgence , of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institution together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by use Article 13 to combat discrimination , and Article 137 to combat exclusion .
we need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now .
the aspiration be fine , President Prodi , we want those aspiration to be match by action .
Madam President , I hope that it be a good omen that there be still a few i & apos ; s leave for me to dot .
Mr Prodi , you set great store in your reform effort on introduce a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe .
however , for the economic sector which I represent , i.e . fishery , this mean change .
we need to break away from planned economy subsidy in favour of a liberal policy which foster personal responsibility .
we must reduce protective tariff in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertaking in the processing industry .
what it come down to be the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousand of job in the processing industry and offshore fishing .
however , I be sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which be both an economic and a social factor , which affect not only Germany but all the coastal region of Europe .
plus , this branch of the economy be one of the few sector in which Europe have fully integrate power to decide and act , which be why we expect to be give a right of codecision here too .
this have since be unanimously approve .
the fishery policy be due for review in a few month & apos ; time , i.e . at the beginning of the year 2000 .
so it be somewhat upsetting that there be not so much a a mention of this branch of the economy be this paper .
I hope that this be a misunderstanding .
please , Mr Prodi , stand by your word and implement your promise .
Madam President , many of the speaker from the Socialist Group have already identify key area where there be gap in the Commission & apos ; s statement .
however , we have acknowledge that this be an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission .
one area that I want to focus on , in addition to those already identify , be that of cultural diversity in Europe .
the introduction to this statement acknowledge under the quality of life section that it be important .
but there be nothing in the statement which indicate that the Commission intend to take any step to deal with the issue of cultural diversity .
unless we address these issue , unless we dismantle these negative stereotype , unless we take what be best from our various culture and language and protect and expand it and ensure that we be serious about have a diverse Europe , we will fail .
those who be currently come to the fore in Europe base on fear will win the day .
if we do not take step to deal with that , we will fail ultimately .
thank you , Mr De Rossa .
before give the floor again to the President of the Commission , I must tell you that I have receive , pursuant to Rule 37 , seven motion for resolution to conclude the debate .
welcome
I would like to inform you that there be a delegation from Kuwait , lead by His Excellency , Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah , Vice-Prime Minister and Defence Minister , here in the official gallery .
on behalf of the House , I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament .
Mr President , I should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activity organise today by the Association of Parliamentary Assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistant to be adopt a soon a possible .
I understand that on 26 January the association write to the College of Quaestors request permission to set up a table outside the Hemicycle today to publicise their initiative .
on the same day , I understand , Mr Balfe give permission for the assistant to go ahead .
the Parliament service ask to meet with the assistant yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangement .
however , the appointment be cancel at the last minute .
Parliament have not yet indicate why permission be withdraw .
Mrs Banotti apparently promise to write a letter explain why permission be withdraw but so far no letter have be receive .
can you explain why the approval give to the assistant be withdraw at the last minute ?
do you agree that the assistant have a legitimate case which must be hear ?
will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last-minute cancellation do not happen again ?
will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistant be adopt a soon a possible ?
finally , will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament & apos ; s rule be properly implement and that assistant be pay , a they should be , on the basis of all the work they do for u ?
without them we would not be able to function .
Mr President , I also rise on a point of order .
be there any rule or regulation that govern demonstration within the building of this Parliament , outside the door of the Hemicycle , to ensure that MEPs be free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate ?
if there be such rule , who have the responsibility for enforce them and what be they do to discharge that responsibility ?
Mr President , I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistant , which we have always consider to be a priority , and inform you that - a the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader , Mr Barón Crespo , we have forward the contract that we draw up with the assistant to the Quaestors .
I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway .
I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise .
Mr President , first of all let me say that I be in full support of a statute for assistant .
yesterday when I arrive in Parliament I be hand a document relate to a propose demonstration by the assistant outside the door of Parliament .
a all colleague will know - and many of you have approach me over the last six month - all exhibition and such like be filter first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament .
to give a non-contentious example , no commercial exhibition can be hold here in Parliament for obvious reason .
follow a letter I receive yesterday , I immediately inform the assistant that we would propose that they be allow to hold a meeting or demonstration , probably in the near future and possibly in the next month .
but all exhibition must be carry out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament .
I sign a letter yesterday afternoon , in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament , in which the assistant be inform of this .
but I be also tell that they be inform verbally of this decision by the Committee of Chairmen of Groups last Thursday , so they be fully aware of the decision .
there be no problem with them tell u the way they feel , there be no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament & apos ; s next part-session .
but there be some misunderstanding , for they do receive a letter from somebody else that they felt give them permission .
but all exhibition be in fact look at first by the so-called Comart committee .
a you can see we have many exhibition around Parliament , whether they be about different country or whatever .
this be not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistant .
thank you , Mrs Banotti .
I think your intervention may clarify various point that be raise .
Mr President , I want to point out an important matter of principle .
I personally believe that it be nothing short of scandalous that we hear Members of this Parliament attack the demonstration rather than look at the solution to the problem , which be fair condition , fair pay and fair hour .
we shall now proceed to the vote.1
vote
Mr President , I be speak on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People & apos ; s Party , the delegation of the Spanish People & apos ; s Party , with regard to Mrs Terrón i Cusí & apos ; s resolution on the area of freedom , security and justice .
there have be some vote where we have not follow the guideline of the Group of the European People & apos ; s Party , and we have vote in favour of the Terrón i Cusí resolution , which we consider on the whole to be excellent .
however , we have vote against paragraph 2 and 6 , because they seem to u to be legally incorrect .
on the other hand , we have vote in favour of Recital J which , in fact , be in line with what I , a draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens & apos ; Freedoms , propose to that Committee , with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference .
we have also vote in favour of paragraph 13 .
an appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for resident of non-EU country be something which the Spanish People & apos ; s Party have be advocate for some time .
for similar reason , we have vote in favour of paragraph 14 which , with the oral amendment , dealt with certain very justifiable concern about the question of subsidiarity , since political right , not just vote in local election , but political right in general term , form part of the sovereignty of Member States .
give the oral amendment , we felt we could vote in favour and that be what we have do .
( da ) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have choose to vote in favour of the propose resolution , but be at the same time aware of the fact that certain area clash with the reservation Denmark have in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wish to respect .
this report which I vote against be le concerned with human right than with & apos ; communitisation & apos ; or the consolidation of Fortress Europe .
the supposed progress achieve in 1999 and mention by the report only occur in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the right of immigrant .
in term of human right , this be a backward step .
Europe be continue to expel national arrive from country regard a dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.Yet some applicant country in central and eastern Europe be take in gypsy refugee expel en masse from Belgium .
Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserter be be refuse refugee status , whereas Pinochet be calmly escape prosecution .
the Europe of Schengen clearly find it much easier to hound the persecute from the south than dictator , even though the UN estimate that we will need 159 million immigrant to maintain a stable population between now and the year 2025 .
Europe should regularise the situation of all it illegal immigrant and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections.Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice .
McCarthy report ( A5-0026 / 2000 )
Mr President , I would firstly like to point out that I be Mayor of Bilbao during the ninety , which give me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot project to be subsidise by the Commission .
secondly , when decide which area must be subsidise , we must concentrate effort on integrated project .
disparate action be not effective .
we have to select location by prioritise those which be most impoverished and needy , in accordance with the objective set , that be to say , the social , economic , environmental and democratic management dimension , a well a the relationship between them .
thirdly , we have to bear in mind the synergy generate by other Community programme , a well a the opportunity for sustainable development in the location or region in question .
finally , we have to put our trust in , and support , the institution which be closest to the citizen , that be , the local council and body .
they have more first-hand knowledge of social needs.They have more involvement in the problem and , furthermore , they know how to conceive project and implement them effectively without weigh them down with bureaucracy , and thereby achieve better result .
lastly , in today & apos ; s vote on our four amendment , two have be approve and the other two reject .
this have oblige u to abstain from the final vote , because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when decide which project must be finance and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate , to URBAN project , that portion of the Structural Funds which it have not spend in accordance with Community programme .
Mr President , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism have an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produce many idea .
a the smallest Community initiative in existence , we therefore propose an increase in it funding through an amendment which be reject .
we regret this a there be actually money leave over from the Structural Funds in some country which could really have help with pilot projects.We should remember that it be these URBAN project which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be establish .
the Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policy which be in place.It should make URBAN project coherent with future project in budget line entitle & apos ; sustainable urban policy & apos ; .
finally , there be currently still no European urban policy within the European Union.Perhaps this point could be develop in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally have a true urban policy .
Mr President , I would like to point out that I vote for this report on sustainable urban development , know a URBAN .
a with all other Community initiative , this be very positive .
Europe be make it presence felt at a time when we be do something for all the citizen of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State , whichever one it may be .
urban be design to find solution to urban decay , and this be something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners & apos ; Party .
there can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city .
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve a an example on how to resolve the problem face by the elderly in city .
. ( da ) The Left & apos ; s five Members of the European Parliament have choose to support LEADER + , the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG , but not URBAN .
at a forthcoming review of these programme , it ought to be establish that the EU & apos ; s effort be to be concentrate upon cross-border task and adapt to the possible enlargement of the EU .
. ( da ) We have vote in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concern the guideline for a Community initiative relating to the economic and social regeneration of city and neighbourhood in crisis and design to promote sustainable development ( URBAN ) .
basically , we be oppose to programme and structural fund of this type but , since the vote only concern how - and not to what extent - these resource be to be use , we have confine ourselves to assess the content and think , in general , that the proposal for regenerate neighbourhood in crisis contain some sensible observation , a well a some good suggestion and criterion for the relevant project .
this report contain general point on what be refer to a the urban regeneration strategy for town centre and neighbourhood affect by the crisis in the capitalist economy and it consequence , i.e . increase unemployment , exclusion and delinquency .
it underline the fact that , in order to ensure sustainable urban development , an urban policy must be implement which do not leave out the main victim of the economic crisis , namely the unemployed , immigrant , refugee , woman and the socially exclude .
however , nothing be say about the cause of this crisis and those responsible for it .
at best this report simply correct certain aspect and effect of the crisis.Yet only scandalously limited resource be available for this work .
this be why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measure plan to help certain social category which be most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consist of pious hope finance on the cheap .
- ( FR ) Mrs McCarthy , lady and gentleman , I be very pleased that the URBAN Community Initiative be be continue a this aim to support the social and economic conversion of city and neighbourhood in crisis , all with a view to achieve sustainable urban development .
with some 80 % of the population of Europe living in an urban area , city be at the forefront of economic , social and cultural change in Europe .
at the same time , the social and economic problem face European society be more pronounced in urban area .
many European city be divide into neighbourhood characterise by high-added-value activity and high-income resident and other district characterise by low income , high unemployment , substandard and overcrowd housing and high level of welfare dependency .
the concentration of economic and social problem in certain urban area call for target intervention take full account of the complexity of the problem involve .
this be why the European Parliament successfully call for the URBAN Community Initiative or CIP to be extend during the reform of the Structural Funds .
the success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period be indisputable .
the result be clear in term of the improvement of the quality of life in the target area .
this CIP have encourage the development of best practice model in the economic , social and environmental sector .
it have also have the distinction of strengthen the role of local authority , the non-governmental sector and local community and of support new partnership approach to urban regeneration .
the new initiative will continue to pursue these goal by reinforce them , while particularly promote equal opportunity between men and woman and integrate socially marginalise and disadvantage group .
we can therefore welcome it adoption .
we must , however , admit that in financial term we can not proclaim a victory !
the total appropriation allocate be not up to the challenge .
the amount for the 1994-1999 period be EUR 900 million and will be EUR 700 million for the 2000-2006 period.This represent a drop of 30 % !
this reduction in funding have lead to a reduction in the number of programme in the new URBAN initiative .
the chosen threshold of 50 project seem too low .
it need to be increase to reflect regional and local factor whilst maintain financial award to the Member States .
in view of this concentration on a limited number of project , the publication and dissemination of the result of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect .
the McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative give u an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matter .
the situation of certain urban area be alarm , with the social distress take the form of unemployment , misery and crime .
drug deal in particular fuel insecurity and delinquency .
face with these social challenge , the effectiveness of the Structural Funds be still in doubt .
subsidiarity should make u realise that the state , exercise it governing function , and local authority be the body most able to intervene appropriately.The state can ensure public safety and the local authority can help disadvantage people .
although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchange between successful enterprise , the problem specific to each urban area can not be deal with in the same way .
the URBAN Community Initiative be help to achieve the European Union & apos ; s desire to communitise urban policy .
it would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate it financial effort on pre-existing European policy .
clearly some people be profit from the opportunity to indulge in another budget bidding race which be particularly mistime when the convergence criterion for EMU be impose a very strict slimming regime on the national budget .
Mrs McCarthy be therefore suggest an increase in the fund allocate to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extol the benefit of a federal Europe .
we should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure be not measure by the volume of funding allocate to the project .
in fact , the beneficiary of too many and too high subsidy will eventually just take these for grant .
the aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility .
finally , the report specifically highlight action in favour of ethnic or sociological minority .
we can only condemn a policy on minority which be inevitably dangerous for social cohesion .
on one hand , this policy encourage the integration of immigrant where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country.This would prevent the development of ethnic ghetto which be nothing more than urban powder keg .
on the other hand , it manipulate the principle of positive discrimination.This be a politically correct fancy which can be just a harmful , a show by the US precedent .
for all these reason , the French delegation of the UEN Group could not approve the McCarthy report .
Decourrière report ( A5-0028 / 2000 )
Mr President , the INTERREG programme be particularly close to our heart .
like many of my colleague , I be pleased that the European Parliament be able to safeguard this initiative .
a I live in the Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud region of Belgium , I be well aware that the region be where Europe be be created.They be where we live the European experience on a daily basis and where the people make European construction come alive .
these project must therefore be properly take into account and must integrate sustainable development .
why be I stress this point ?
the answer be quite simply because the project currently be submit be still too often damage to the environment due to the way they be submit .
for example , to accept new road be to accept new pollution within the European Union.This go totally against the policy which we be propose to fight greenhouse gas emission , for example .
I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the EU & apos ; s policy be integrate into the project submit and that the goal of reduce CO2 for example form an experimental add value in the project propose .
I be particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructure which be under construction .
we know that some Member States be still waver , for example , between rail and road for route through vulnerable area such a the Pyrenees , a in the Aspe valley .
however , I be also thinking of my own region where my government be still debate whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway , the A32 .
in this respect too , I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensure that there be real cohesion between the various policy , specifically in the INTERREG programme which be be submit .
these frontier stretch a far a African state and the Middle East : we must take greater account of the fact that it be also important to develop coastal region in every part of Europe .
a an MEP from a border region , I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest .
we can never talk enough about the difficulty experience in the past by maritime and landlocked border region which have be cut off economically , socially and culturally .
due to the existence of these border , they have become peripheral area within the country to which they belong.This have too often lead the national authority to neglect these region in national policy .
this be why the INTERREG Community Initiative be launch in 1990 .
this programme be design to encourage cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union .
INTERREG serve principally to fund Community scheme to develop SMEs , education and training , cultural exchange , action to combat health problem , the protection and improvement of the environment , energy , transport and telecommunication network .
I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourage the involvement of local and regional authority in the process of European integration .
more active participation by these authority in Community initiative should be promote , bear in mind that in many case they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal framework and different level of development on either side of the border .
in cross-border cooperation , greater emphasis must be place on improve the condition for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertaking which be the job creator .
in the same respect , give that structural unemployment be responsible for 50 % of all unemployment , the INTERREG fund make available must be sufficient to supplement national measure promote employment .
obstacle too often cause by double taxation and social protection be prevent , brake or hinder cross-border mobility .
I hope that the project include within the programme can help to provide solution to these problem and to implement in practical term the principle of free movement of worker which be in a bad way in my region !
INTERREG resource must also contribute to the development of a European research area .
finally , and in particular , expectation in the region about this initiative be high give that small town not eligible for Objective 2 funding be hop to obtain compensation through INTERREG !
the challenge be therefore immense.The integration of the border region will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy !
I hope everyone , like Mr Decourrière , whom I congratulate , will realise this !
- ( FR ) The INTERREG Community Initiative be just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy .
this apparently generous policy , officially intend to help problem region , be a fool & apos ; s bargain for French taxpayer .
France contribute 17 % of the European budget yet will receive only 8 % of the regional Structural Funds .
between 1994 and 1999 , our region annually receive an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006 .
my region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be particularly affect with French Hainaut lose the aid pay to Objective 1 region .
this loss be unjustified in a region whose main activity have be ruin by free-trade Europe .
the European regional policy also reinforce the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authority be invite to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds .
this be a Europe of region in which the region , which be weaker than the nation state , will easily submit to Brussels .
the INTERREG initiative , launch in 1990 to prepare the border region for a Europe without border and therefore without nation , sit comfortably within this philosophy .
however , Mr Decourrière do show some common sense by denounce the failing of the Brussels technocrat .
these failing will result in particular in the late implementation of INTERREG III and therefore in financial loss for the region in receipt of aid .
we also agree with the rapporteur about ask for more attention to be pay to small and medium-sized undertaking and , of course , about refuse to use outside service provider .
these be the procedure which cause the corruption scandal in the previous Commission .
however , these isolated element which make sense and for which we vote , in no way remedy the Eurofederalist philosophy which characterise the Community initiative , particularly INTERREG .
this be why the National Front vote against the report .
the European Parliament have deliver an opinion on the Commission guideline for the INTERREG Community Initiative concern cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation .
I want to defend an amendment table by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative .
this do not involve the concern about the future of the Atlantic Arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime border into strand A on cross-border cooperation .
in the Commission guideline , few maritime area be eligible for INTERREG IIIA.The amendment to the Decourrière report aim to make INTERREG more maritime-oriented .
this be an important development which must be support a it be the future of the EU which be at stake .
I be aware of the Commission & apos ; s reluctance on this subject a it announce during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November .
however , I must point out that prevent the recognition of maritime border amount to deny the existence of an area which have great potential for project and innovation .
one example of this be the & apos ; Celtic & apos ; area which encompass the territory of Brittany in France , Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom and Cork and Waterford in Ireland.This be an area whose locally-based economy be characterise by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri-foodstuffs sector .
it also have excellent cultural and relational link , through twinnings for example.INTERREG III , strand A , would allow the region in this area to advance a number of structural project need to develop small and medium-sized undertaking and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer .
the European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide link between region .
this policy would have important economic consequence for the fishing industry in Brittany in that catch could be unload at Irish advance base in order to then be transport to the Breton agri-foodstuffs industry .
the integration of the maritime border into strand A would finally allow the western periphery to be recognise a a unique and important economic area which be confront by the & apos ; continentalisation & apos ; of the European Union .
this would show respect for these peripheral area which be rather concern about enlargement to the east .
the maritime world have great potential .
we therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community program which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be define .
. ( da ) The European project begin a a partnership between States .
this partnership have ensure peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 year .
a a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world , of which the EU be just one proof , and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our Western value , competition on the world market have grow considerably within the last few decade .
the EU should be prepare to meet that competition .
we can only do that by intensify co-operation within the Community .
it should not be about greater integration of the EU country in the form of a federation but about use our economic potential across national border .
it be about co-operating on joint project and about unifying force on all side .
a programme such a INTERREG be there precisely to support regional development project across national border , project which make it possible to build centre of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitor on a global scale .
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme .
. ( FR ) Mr Decourrière & apos ; s report be not without merit : at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the INTERREG initiative and it role in open up border region , it come out in favour of SMEs in paragraph 16 .
I and my colleague Dominique Souchet , who be well verse in this matter , have table five amendment highlight the role of SMEs and craft trade within the framework of INTERREG , the importance of cooperation between undertaking and the need to involve economic and social partner in the design and implementation of the programme and I welcome the fact that these amendment be adopt unanimously .
nonetheless , the French delegation in our group be unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the federalist faction have divert the INTERREG initiative from it original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nation .
we have no intention of give Brussels the job of regulate regional planning in the Member States , a suggest in recital of the report .
we only ask one thing of the Commission : that it confine itself to ensure that the implementation of joint policy do not upset the balance of regional planning in our territory .
the destructive effect of the CAP and EMU on the balance between region , especially on the vitality of the more rural , the more remote and the least populated region , be proof positive of the fact that such ambition be not a sinecure , far from it .
we be therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encourage interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sideline the Member States .
this infatuation with strand IIIC be all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledge in his explanatory statement that & apos ; the draft guideline do not provide any indication of possible field of co-operation & apos ; ( p.17 ) and that & apos ; the responsibility be diffuse and vague & apos ; ( p.18 ) .
call under these circumstance , a he do in paragraph 20 , for the budget for this strand to be increase be another example of the irresponsible and ideological outbidding tactic which be customary in this House .
lastly , there be the desire express both in the Commission document and Mr Decourrière & apos ; s report of use INTERREG for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans : I do not think that the Structural Funds should be use to repair the damage which the Americans inflict on Serbia during bombardment which be a criminal a they be ineffectual .
it be up to Washington , not u , to assume responsibility for a conflict which be trigger merely to serve it interest .
the French delegation in our group be therefore unable to support the Decourrière report and will choose to abstain during the final vote .
Procacci report ( A5-0025 / 2000 )
Mr President , I vote for the Procacci report on rural development , not only because I endorse the major policy line of the LEADER programme , but also because it complement the URBAN programme , which I speak about earlier .
just a elderly people in city be very isolated , so the elderly be fast become the sole inhabitant of rural area because young people be move to the city : they be draw by the bright light , and the pub , and the countryside and rural area be be empty .
I therefore believe that it be very important for everyone to back this European Union plan and for it to be further develop .
- ( PT ) Although this Community initiative , LEADER + , follow on from previous initiative , it have some unique feature .
one of these of course be the reduction by around one half in appropriation make available even though they will cover a longer period .
nevertheless , new objective have be include , specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000 , for which all rural region will be eligible .
in spite of the fact that this Community initiative be aim at rural development , it do not address the issue of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way , and this be unacceptable .
without agriculture , the rural world will disappear .
this mean that any strategy for rural development must be base on agriculture & apos ; s internal potential while at the same time develop a many other activity a possible in order to prevent the desertification of the rural world .
this be why we consider it essential to improve the report by mean of our proposal deliberately to include agricultural activity and farmer in the strategy for rural development and to request more appropriation in order not to threaten the survival of the programme in those rural region which be cover before.We also want to ensure that the new programme continue to prioritise the less-favoured region .
our position on LEADER be a product of our more general assessment of the EU & apos ; s overall agricultural policy .
both LEADER 1 and LEADER 2 , which be implement in the 1990s , be ingredient of the new CAP that emerge after it review in 1992 and , along with other respective measure , they constitute the so-termed second pillar of the EU & apos ; s rural development policy .
their real aim be to moderate and disguise the new CAP & apos ; s disastrous consequence and the disorientation of small and medium-scale farmer , and not to develop the rural area or retain the agricultural population therein a be hypocritically declare in their objective .
this be prove by the fact that in the area where those initiative be implement , farm income and employment decrease rapidly , which result in their depopulation .
a characteristic example be Greece , which a an Objective 1 country be include a a whole in the LEADER Community initiatives , and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reach approximately 2.3 % , while between 1994 and 1999 farm income decrease by 15.2 % .
we think LEADER + will be even more ineffectual than LEADER 1 and LEADER 2 , for the following reason .
the real aim of LEADER + be the same a those of LEADERs 1 and 2 , in other word to moderate and disguise the negative consequence of the CAP to be implement in the context of Agenda 2000 and the WTO .
the present CAP , however , be worse than it predecessor and it also start from a worse basis , grant that the 1992 CAP review and the GATT agreement in 1995 have create serious problem and impasse for the agricultural economy .
the selection criterion and the activity that be subsidise under LEADER do , in the best case , moderate some partial problem of the countryside , which be of secondary importance , but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relation and pander to conscience .
in no case , however , be they programme for the integrated development of the select area and they do not create permanent job in the countryside because most of the activity there be not productive in nature .
the actual appropriation available for LEADER + compare with LEADER 2 be smaller despite their increase by 15 % ( from EUR 1 775 million for LEADER 2 to EUR 2 020 million for LEADER + ) .
this be because the 15 % increase be nominal and not real , grant that average yearly inflation in the Community during those year be approximately 2 % .
LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2 .
LEADER + can cover all the region of the EU , while LEADER 2 cover only the Objective 1 region and some Objective 5b and 6 region .
we disagree with many of the report & apos ; s view .
once more , we point to the negative change of the CAP ( 1992 - Agenda 2000 ) .
we do not think LEADER + will contribute substantively towards solve the countryside & apos ; s problem , which be characterise by the decline of farming , which be and should remain the countryside & apos ; s basic social and economic branch .
for our part , we will tell the farmer about the expediency of these programme .
we will make every effort to improve them a much a possible and prevent them from be waste , and most important of all , we will try to foster the struggle of farmer against the disastrous CAP which be disinherit them and lead them towards economic decline and the desertion of the countryside .
unless this CAP be overthrow , no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmer and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside .
all the Members in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group vote in favour of almost the whole of the Procacci report on the LEADER + Community Initiative .
however , we amend the draft report adopt by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain point which will make this Community initiative more effective .
in particular we felt it be necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedure which prove to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative .
